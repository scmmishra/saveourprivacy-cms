702,"Basics of data protection and privacy",basic-background-reading-on-data-protection-in-india,,,admin,2018-06-01,,Yes,live,"Akash Kumar Singh, Tanya Aggarwal, Mahimna Kandpal","<p><strong><em>""What is personal data?""</em></strong><br /></p>
<p>Data that can be used to identify an individual qualifies as personal data. </p>
<p><strong><em>""What can be done with it?""</em></strong></p>
<p>Personal data today has immense power and value. It can be collected, processes, stored or disseminated. Data protection is the mechanism by which laws provide rights to individuals over their personal data, restrict misuse and breach of privacy. </p>
<p><strong><em>""Should I worry about the apps on my smartphone? They would not do anything wrong, would they?""</em></strong></p>
<p>That's not the point. We can trust our smartphones and governments better with accountability and rights. Data is power and we should always be the ones in control. So, if you do not have a right over your own personal data, a lot of decisions regarding you will be made without your consent, choice or knowledge. </p>
<p><strong><em>""Is our privacy protected?""</em></strong></p>
<p>Last year a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court unanimously held that all our fundamental rights link to the right to privacy. It repeatedly stated that in our tech driven, digital world of blockchains, big data and algorithms, it is essential for the government to make a data protection law to protect our privacy. </p>
<p>Sadly, at present there is no comprehensive legislation on data protection in India. To fill in this vacuum a draft citizen's law, titled as the, ""India Privacy Code, 2018"" has been put forth on <a href=""http://www.saveourprivacy.in"">www.saveourprivacy.in</a> for debate, discussion and endorsement. </p>
<p><em><strong>""A lot seems to be happening on privacy recently. What's going on ?""</strong></em></p>
<p>Since 2006, many attempts to draft a data protection and privacy law in India have been made. <strong>The Personal Data Protection Bill</strong> tabled in the Parliament in 2006 and drafted on the general framework of the European Union Data Privacy Directive, 1996 was one such attempt.<br /></p>
<p>Subsequently, the Planning Commission constituted a committee was chaired by former Delhi High Court <strong>Chief Justice AP Shah</strong>. It published a 9-point focused <a href=""http://planningcommission.nic.in/reports/genrep/rep_privacy.pdf"">Report of the Group of Experts on Privacy </a> in 2012 but no effective follow up was taken up until last year.</p>
<p>In about the past 12 months we have witnessed a plethora of debates on data protection In India.</p>

856,"How does #SaveOurPrivacy deal with Aadhaar?",how-does-the-indian-privacy-code-2018-deal-with-aadhaar,,,admin,2018-06-08,,Yes,live,"Apar Gupta","<p><img src=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/save-our-privacy.svg"" alt=""save-our-privacy.svg#asset:22"" /><br /></p>
<p><strong>It shuts it down. Read on.</strong><br /></p>
<p>Privacy and data protection is a wide subject which has various facets. We highlighted in <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/saveourprivacy-launches-a-community-project-powered-by-iff/"">our presser</a> that one of the recurring problems facing us is Aadhaar. We used the specific language of, ""policy fix"" to go beyond meaningless, artificial reform to challenging the very basis of Aadhaar. This was as per the drafting exercise carried over weeks which is explained and set out in this post. </p>
<p>To us several fundamental features of Aadhaar as per the Aadhaar Act, 2018 are : 
</p>
<ol><li>Mandatory use due to statutory language and administrative practice</li><li>It is a universal digital ID not tied to any specific purpose</li><li>It relies on biometrics which are an incredibly sensitive form of data</li><li>It results in mass surveillance as a precondition to availing essential services
</li><li>Due to its architecture it makes people vulnerable to data breaches and identity thefts
</li></ol><p>The <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/bill"">Indian Privacy Code, 2018</a> will attempt to prevent these ""features"" to operate against us. </p>
<p>The first thing to consider is that the <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/bill"">Indian Privacy Code, 2018</a> is a comprehensive data protection statute that overrides all existing legislations [<strong>Refer Section 85</strong>]. Hence, it will apply over and above the Aadhaar Act, 2016. We have inserted specific statutory language that the Privacy Commission which will have powers to issue orders to the UIDAI [<strong>Refer Section 53</strong>]. Hence, privacy and data protections under the Indian Privacy Code will be given first preference in the pecking order.<br /></p>
<ul><li>The Privacy Code has the consent framework deeply baked within it (<strong>Section 3(5)</strong>). This is illustrated in several provisions for meaningful consent beyond the ineffective terms of services and privacy policies [<strong>Sections 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12</strong>]. It requires people are explained what data is being parted, what are the consequences of it, and maintain the continuing power of the individual. More importantly, it clearly demarcates a statutory option for people to refuse their consent. This undercuts the Aadhaar Act but more importantly the administrative practices which have resulted in making it mandatory. 
</li></ul><ul><li>The Indian Privacy Code is built off <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/principles"">seven progressive privacy principles</a> including use and purpose limitation in the collection and processing of data. Hence, it will limit universal, purposeless digital forms of identification such as Aadhaar or severely curtail its application which has seen unrestricted use (<strong>Sections 7(3), 10(2), 15</strong>). We specifically need to improve language on this and request help. 
</li></ul><ul><li>The Indian Privacy Code classifies biometrics as a heightened class of sensitive personal data. We have given specific regulatory power on this to the Privacy Commission (<strong>Section 19(2)</strong>). Again, existing statutory language under the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 will lean towards prohibiting the use of biometrics by the UIDAI for purposeless use, or authorisation channels as is done through its network. 
</li></ul><ul><li>The Indian Privacy Code has several provisions against (a) machine learning or algorithmic systems that determine legal entitlements (<strong>Section 27</strong>); and (b) a specific bar to denial of essential services (<strong>Section 13</strong>). All these provisions will override any provisions, interpretations under the Aadhaar Act or notifications under any other laws which make it a precondition for essential services, benefits and subsidies. 
</li></ul><ul><li>The Indian Privacy Code has pro-active breach notification obligations (<strong>Section 16(4)</strong>) and penalty provisions for data breaches (<strong>Section 73</strong>). This applies equally to private parties and statutory bodies such as the UIDAI (<strong>Section 2(1)(l)</strong>).</li></ul><p><strong>An Appeal</strong></p>
<p>We acknowledge the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 is not perfect text. </p>
<p>That is why we keep going back to the <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/principles"">Seven Privacy Principles</a> to guide us and continue to request suggestions on improving language which recognises user rights over personal data.</p>
<p>We also need to state it clearly : The Indian Privacy Code, 2018 is wider effort on protecting privacy and data protection. Also, it is not against all forms of digital IDs that can be privacy compliant under the <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/principles"">Seven Privacy Principles</a>. We believe it is possible for technology to work for people while they still retain power and control over it. Clearly, Aadhaar in its present form and its core features is fundamentally incompatible with the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 but more importantly the <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/principles"">Seven Principles</a> which have gone into its framing. 
</p>
<p>We also note that any Aadhaar repeal act limited to expressly repealing the Aadhaar Act may be an effort worth consideration and are open to conversation, support and collaboration on it. We welcome any such measure by people but again undertake and promise that the <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/bill"">Indian Privacy Code, 2018</a> and the <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/principles"">Seven Privacy Principles</a> are incompatible with Aadhaar. Help us articulate them better. </p><p><br /></p><p><em>Psst.. This post was authored by a volunteer to promote greater conversation on data protection.

1069,"Why women need a data protection law : Online shopping carts, pregnancy apps to their online presence itself",why-women-need-a-data-protection-law,,,admin,2018-06-11,,Yes,live,"Pragati Sharma","<p>It often happens that before I post something on my Instagram profile, which happens to be private, I wonder not only about how it will be perceived by others (a usual side effect of being a social media user) but also how it another person can simply take a screenshot and share or use it without my consent. Hypocritically enough, sometimes, I do, too. Even though photo sharing based social media apps alert the user when someone takes a screen grab of the post (Instagram and Snapchat stories), however, the same does nothing to deter sharing and subsequent use of the screen grab.</p>
<p><img src=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Untitled.jpeg"" alt=""Untitled.jpeg#asset:1066"" /><br /></p>
<p>In this age and time, the expectation of privacy has reduced, both online and offline. In public we are constantly under surveillance in one way or another, be it Credit Card swipes or CCTV Cameras in public places. One knows that the data we share online, odds are that not only it can be viewed by people who do not have direct access to it, but also stored, shared, and used in many ways to target the data sharer as a user, consumer and a citizen. </p>
<p>However, the expectation of reduced privacy does not forgo at the same time, the very expectation of privacy. This is at the core of the doctrine of informational self-determination in which privacy continues to exist for a person despite its reduced expectation. This applies especially for women as several studies and experts have concluded. 
 </p>
<p><strong>Experts and studies</strong></p>
<p>According to a study conducted by the University of Washington to assess the perception of privacy in a public place, especially where the surveillance is not related to security, ‘<em>women are more concerned than men about their privacy,</em> <em>both as watcher and the watched.</em>’ Furthermore, ‘<em>A majority of men and women interviewed said they would be uncomfortable with having their images recorded, as opposed to being used in a real-time display. The study also shows almost twice as many women as men voicing concern about even real-time display of their images</em>.’
 </p>
<p>It is no secret that online profiles of users are studied for their information in order to provide more individualised experience within the platform. The demographics are stored and used to observe, predict, and manipulate the user behaviour. The incident involving Facebook and Cambridge Analytica is only the most recent example of how user demographics was used to predict and manipulate behaviour. Women from the age of 18-49 are considered a highly valued demographic in terms of internet marketing opportunities. Consider the example of iVillage, cited by Erik Larson in the New Yorker, where a pregnant woman can enter her due date and receive a calendar showing day by day what's likely to be happening inside her body. Women with overlapping calendars are directed to a ""<em>Pregnancy Circle</em>"" an online support group where they can trade advice and concerns and are simultaneously prompted to purchase items such as books from Amazon.com, baby goods from iVillage's iBaby, and maternity clothes from iVillage's iMaternity. 
 </p>
<p>How many times have you filled your online shopping cart with all the things you liked while browsing, but did not complete the purchase and after a few hours received an email from the said website for “<em>abandoning your cart</em>” or something more sentimental, “<em>your cart misses you.</em>” Or when you see an advertisement of a detox tea to shed the last 5 pounds, because you happened to Google a celebrity’s diet secrets, or simply because you subscribe to a health and wellness website. 
 </p>
<p>If one compares the prospects that online marketing and shopping holds to a coal mine, websites that target female users are mining diamonds from the proverbial coal mine. </p>
<p>Professor Ann Bartow of the University Of New Hampshire School Of Law, in <em>Our Data, Ourselves: Privacy, Propertization, and Gender, </em>opines that “<em>unregulated online data collection is a threat to all consumers. Because women do most of the shopping, and most of the ""sharing,"" in meet space, and their presence is increasing in cyberspace, they are most vulnerable to the slings and arrows of online consumer profilers</em>.” She further argues that collection of information online is of ""<em>singular importance to women.</em>” </p>
<p>This is primarily because women control the spending habits and patterns of their households, making them a special target for collection of information and profiling on the basis of the data collected. Bartow argues that online data collection needs to be regulated in order to prevent women from being targeted.</p>
<p><strong>Working towards some solutions</strong></p>
<p>The irony remains that if you want better, more individualised services, you need to share information that is personal, and if you do, you are a target and another valuable chunk of data to internet based marketing. 
 </p>
<p>According to Ana Brandusescu, a Research and Policy Officer at the Web Foundation, “<em>the link between these topics and gender might not appear obvious at first glance; gender plays a significant role in the design and implementation of technology, online privacy, and data protection. In turn, how technology is deployed, how online privacy is protected, and how data is collected and used all impact women differently than men.</em>”
 </p>
<p>However, in the case of women, the expectation of privacy is not limited to online shopping demographics, but also extends to digital security. In case of women, there is threat to their emotional and mental wellbeing. There are so many instances where prominent female activists became targets of online smear campaigns, bullying and gender based harassment, and in many cases forced to shut down given the disturbing and sexually abusive nature of the threats by cyber mobs. 
 </p>
<p>Anita L Allen, Professor of Law at the University of Pennsylvania, in her paper Gender and Privacy in Cyberspace says, “<em>A woman-centred perspective on privacy in cyberspace is vital because only with such a perspective can we begin to evaluate how the advent of the personal computer and global networking, conjoined with increased opportunity for women, has affected the privacy predicament that once typified many American women's lives</em>.”
 </p>
<p>Working towards solutions that dismantle patriarchy based cultures is hard. A data protection law is not a silver bullet which will take care of these deep, cultural issues. But it holds a promise that it can return back control to people, especially women online. While the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 is far from a perfect, <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/principles"">the seven principles by focussing on protecting the autonomy of an individual</a> are a modest guide to how a data protection law may be able to deal with some of the problems most women face online on social media.</p>

But quite often social media is criticised as being of little social use. Cynics would classify online conversation within categories of chatter on celebrity and pop culture, posting the next hot meme, engaging in the cycles of online social outrage or even cheering for our favourite sports team. While this only makes us human, even overt attempts of online activism are discounted as lacking authenticity, diversity and impact. We have some limited evidence to the contrary. </p>
<p>A little over two weeks ago we put out a call on social media for people to volunteer their skills and time to create Indian language versions of the 7 privacy principles and a summary of the Indian Privacy Code, 2018. More than 27 people wrote in, which is a growing number as we continue to receive emails everyday. Strangers over the internet have put in time, collaborated and created versions of the<a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/principles""> 7 privacy principles</a><a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/blog/help-us-translate-the-7-privacy-principles""></a> in Bengali, Hindi, Khasi, Marathi, and Tamil.

10540,"Statement of solidarity - RTI and RTP activists",statement-of-solidarity-rti-and-rtp-activists,,,admin,2018-07-27,,Yes,live,"Multiple Individuals and Organisations ","<p>A day long workshop on the issues of the Right to Information (RTI), the Right to Privacy (RTP), the proposed data protection legislation and their intersections was held on 17th July 2018. The consultation was attended by members of various peoples' campaigns and movements, researchers, legal scholars and citizens interested in, and affected by, issues pertaining to transparency and privacy.</p>
<p>This workshop was organised in the light of the government’s doublespeak on the rights to information and privacy. <a href=""https://thewire.in/politics/rti-narendra-modi-college-degree"">Privacy is cited by the government to deny information crucial to hold those in power to account</a> while, at the same time, privacy is <a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/No-fundamental-right-to-privacy-to-citizens-Centre-tells-SC/articleshow/48171323.cms"">denied to citizens when it comes to collecting excessive information for projects such as Aadhaar</a>.
</p>
<p>As a statement of solidarity within the civil society among those promoting the rights to information and privacy, the following resolutions were passed:
</p>
<ul><li>The citizens' Rights to Information and Privacy are both fundamental rights under the Constitution of India and the State must protect, promote and fulfill both these rights to further democratic values and protect constitutional freedoms.
</li><li>There is a need for legislation on Privacy and Data Protection in order to adequately protect the privacy of citizens and protections in such a law should be oriented on the rights of natural persons and extend against both State and non-State actors.
</li><li>This <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1by386E8-goxwUCCCP80KdGI3x4ItzIXA/view?usp=sharing"">legal framework for giving effect to citizens' right to privacy should emerge from a pre-legislative consultative process</a> so that the relevant legislation incorporates concerns of the wide set of stakeholders that such a law will inevitably affect.
</li><li>Neither the recognition of the Right to Privacy nor the legislation of a privacy and data protection law requires any amendment to the RTI Act. The legal framework for privacy and data protection should complement the RTI Act and in no way undermine existing statutory framework that enables citizens to use transparency for holding power structures to account.

10591,"Initial statement on Justice Srikrishna Committee Report",initial-statement-on-justice-srikrishna-committee-report,,,admin,2018-07-27,,Yes,live,"SaveOurPrivacy Team","<p>The Expert Committee chaired by Retd. Justice B.N. Srikrishna submitted its <a href=""http://meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Data_Protection_Committee_Report.pdf"">176 page report</a> to the Minister of Electronics and Information Technology at 1600 Hrs on 27 July 2018 (today). The Committee also submitted a draft of the legislation on data protection titled, ‘<a href=""http://meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Personal_Data_Protection_Bill%2C2018_0.pdf"">The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018</a>’. After weeks of secrecy, <a href=""https://www.thequint.com/news/india/srikrishna-committee-on-data-protection-rti-denied"">denial of information in RTIs</a> about the proceedings of the Committee, the report as well as the draft legislation have now been placed in public domain. It is a welcome step to see a comprehensive data protection and privacy framework finally publicly proposed for India - home to over 1/5th of the world’s population and the second largest internet user base.<br /></p>
<p>In the August last year, a month after the constitution of this <a href=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/justice-bn-srikrishna-to-head-committee-for-data-protection-framework/articleshow/59866006.cms"">ten-membered committee</a>, the Supreme Court had delivered its landmark<em> Puttaswamy</em> judgment interpreting the right to privacy as a fundamental right. The judgment was expected to work as the guiding principle of the experts’ committee. It is our hope that the bill provides a substantive manifestation of the fundamental right to privacy and plugs the hole in Indian legal framework where no effective data protections rights, regulation, and remedy exist. 
</p>
<p>Now that the report and the Bill have been submitted to the Ministry, it will consider the bill, perhaps make amendments and then may choose to bring the bill to Parliament - for enactment. It remains to be seen whether the Ministry places the Bill in the on-going Monsoon session of Parliament or not. The onus now lies on the Union executive and eventually the Parliament of India to provide our nation a comprehensive data protection and privacy framework. Having said that, it is important that a thorough and transparent public consultation is now undertaken on the Draft Bill before it is passed by Parliament. The Government is mandated to do so under its own Pre-Legislative Consultation Policy of 2014. 
</p>
<p>While the development of a data protection framework in India is encouraging, many gaps reveal themselves in the current documents submitted by this government committee:
</p>
<ol><li>Many exceptions for processing of data by the government can be seen. This seems to dilute the rights of the citizens with respect to their data vis a vis the the State. 
</li><li>There is a dire need for surveillance law reform in India. It was our hope that this effort would provide a comprehensive framework overhauling surveillance and interception in India - in consonance with the international standards on necessary and proportionate principles, along with providing proper judicial scrutiny. However, the report and bill does not seem to provide substantive changes in the surveillance regime in India.
</li><li>As noted in an official dissent by certain members of the committee, Rishikesha T. Krishnan and Rama Vedashree, the provisions for keeping a copy of all data in India is concerning. This move towards data localisation takes away from the open character of our global internet and is disproportionate to the benefits (if any) it would achieve. 
</li></ol><p>We would like to point out that there have been previous attempts at proposing laws for protection of data and privacy, including expert recommendations like the <a href=""http://planningcommission.nic.in/reports/genrep/rep_privacy.pdf"">Report of Group of experts on Privacy under Justice AP Shah</a> and the draft bill prepared internally within the Union Government across 2011-2015. There have also been attempts in the past to reform our intelligence agencies with respect to their surveillance and interception functions, as well as place them under some form of legal oversight. But it isn’t clear how much of these past attempts have informed the proceedings of the current Committee and its recommendations. We are in the process of going through the bill and the report in a much more comprehensive manner. We shall be providing a detailed take on the bill as well as an evaluation of the bill when compared to the <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/principles"">seven privacy principles</a> proposed in the Indian Privacy Code, 2018.
</p>
<p>This is an important day for the nation - in its move towards securing the rights of its citizens. The report is not the end of the process, but instead marks the beginning of the development of a comprehensive data protection and privacy regulation in India. We hope to continue engaging with the government and our elected lawmakers, and continue the struggle to #SaveOurPrivacy. A strong privacy and data protection law must come into force before our next general election - this is a critical step to protect our increasingly digital democracy.

11023,"Celebrating #PrivacyDay with action",celebrating-privacyday-with-action,,,admin,2018-08-24,,Yes,live,"SaveOurPrivacy Drafting Volunteers","<p>Last year on August 24, 2017 the Supreme Court affirmed our right to privacy. 9 judges of the court underscored its importance and need linking it to equality, our right to life, freedom of expression -- the entire chapter on fundamental right. This was a significant victory which deserves to be celebrated, not only as a marker, but as a promise that must be fulfilled. This principle and promise will only be fulfilled with clear public actions that cause impact and bring greater liberty, autonomy and dignity to the people of India.</p>
<p>The SaveOurPrivacy.in effort wants to set out a clear plan, indicate public commitments on what it plans as the future steps as this campaign evolves and matures relying on the support of more than 10,000 people and 27 organisations. 
</p>
<p>Our principal objective remains getting an effective, citizen centric and strong privacy and data protection law such as the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 through our legislatures. To do this we propose the following steps: 
</p>
<ol><li>Respond to the Draft Bill proposed by the Justice Srikrishna Committee and help all our supporters and those concerned about privacy with resources to help them reply and make their views known. 
</li><li>We are going to keep working and talking to lawmakers all over India to ensure that privacy and data protection is a reality. Some of the volunteers have already assisted Shri Shashi Tharoor’s office a year back in filing a user centric privacy bill in parliament. We will continue to engage with lawmakers to have the core ideas of the the Indian Privacy Code reflected in legislative proposals in parliament and even state legislatures.
</li><li>One of the key tasks which has been promised, and will be delivered is an updated version of the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 which takes into account not only the public feedback but also the Srikrishna Report and the Draft Bill. 
</li></ol><p>We also recognise that till we get a comprehensive privacy and data protection law, there will be a need for constant vigilance and citizen action through courts, regulatory bodies and public consultation. We will remain concerned and depending on our resources and ability try our best to do the following: 
</p>
<ol><li>Engage with regulatory bodies and courts to ensure that your privacy is protected and respected by corporations and the government. We are concerned and will attempt to draw public attention towards future public projects such as mass installation of CCTV’s and AI technologies which are being used for policing functions. 
</li><li>Some of this litigation includes parts of IFF’s work which has used the Indian Privacy Code as a framework to engage in actions on the Social Media Communication Hub (Notice to Ministry of Information and Broadcasting), Whatsapp Data Sharing (Intervention in the Supreme Court of India) and the Right to Be Forgotten litigation (Need to balance the need for privacy with freedom of speech and expression).
</li></ol><p>A core part of this campaign has also been to engage on privacy through public education and community action. We will continue our partnerships in the ongoing conversation on privacy and data protection in a rights based framework by: 
</p>
<ol><li>Making videos and speaking at various forums. This includes assisting creative professionals meaningfully explain and engage on issues of privacy and data protection.
</li><li>Looking to create more local language translations of the 7 Privacy Principles.</li></ol><p>Finally, privacy and data protection is a cause we believe requires collaborative work between different organisations and forging partnerships. It is a shared objective which goes much beyond this campaign, the organisations and the people associated with it. We will continue to deepen our engagement, bring greater care and consideration in our efforts as we learn and engage with allies to ensure India gets a massive win for freedom, autonomy and dignity. For now, we celebrate today as #PrivacyDay</p>",

11167,"Joint statement by RTI and privacy activists on amendments proposed to RTI by Srikrishna Committee",joint-statement-by-rti-and-privacy-activists-on-amendments-proposed-to-rti-by-srikrishna-committee,,,admin,2018-09-18,,Yes,live,"Various Activists and Campaigns","<p><u><b>Joint s</b></u><u><b>tatement </b></u><u><b>by </b></u><u><b>RTI and privacy activists</b></u> <u><b>on </b></u><u><b>the </b></u><u><b>amendments to Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act proposed by the Committee of Experts under the Chairpersonship of Justice B. N. Srikrishna</b></u>
</p>
<p>The Right to Information (RTI) and the Right to Privacy (RTP) are fundamental rights flowing from the Indian Constitution. The State has an obligation to protect and promote both rights.
</p>
<p>To strengthen democracy and constitutional freedoms, it is critical that the two rights be carefully balanced. The Justice Srikrishna Committee, tasked with drafting the Data Protection Bill was therefore expected to develop a framework harmonizing the need to protect certain kinds of personal data with the provisions of the Right to Information Act, 2005, which lays out the statutory framework for Indian citizens to access information, including personal information.
</p>
<p>However, the Draft Data Protection Bill, 2018 (DPB) prepared by the committee, fails to safeguard and balance the two. If accepted, the amendments proposed to the RTI Act, 2005 through the DPB will severely restrict the scope of the RTI Act and adversely impact the ability of people to access information.
</p>
<p>Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act, 2005 states:
</p>
<p>“<i>8. (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen,-</i>
</p>
<p><i>xxx</i>
</p>
<p><i>(j) information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information:”</i>
</p>
<p>However, the exemption is not absolute and information has be disclosed if it is such that cannot be denied to the Parliament or a State Legislature (proviso to 8(1)), if public interest in disclosure outweighs the harm to the protected interests (section 8(2)) or if the information relates to any event or matter which has taken place twenty years ago (section 8(3)).
</p>
<p>The Justice Srikrishna Committee has proposed that Section 8(1)(j) be amended to read as follows<a href=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/2/#m_-6086216051704750316_m_3530659471583730558_sdfootnote1sym"" class=""m_-6086216051704750316m_3530659471583730558sdfootnoteanc""><sup>1</sup></a>:
</p>
<p>“<i>8. (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen,-</i>
</p>
<p>xxx
</p>
<p><i>(j) information which relates to personal data which is likely to cause harm to a data principal, where such harm outweighs the public interest in accessing such information having due regard to the common good of promoting transparency and accountability in the functioning of the public authority;</i>
</p>
<p><i>Provided, disclosure of information under this clause shall be notwithstanding anything contained in the Personal Data Protection Act, 2018;</i>
</p>
<p><i>Provided further, that the information, which cannot be denied to the Parliament or a State Legislature shall not be denied to any person.</i>
</p>
<p><i>Explanation: For the purpose of this section, the terms “personal data” , “data principal” and “harm” shall have the meaning assigned to these terms in the Personal Data Protection Act, 2018.”</i>
</p>
<p>Currently, in order to invoke section 8(1)(j) to deny personal information, atleast one of the following grounds has to be proven- information sought has <b>no relationship to any</b> <b>public activity;</b> or information sought has <b>no relationship to any</b> <b>public interest; </b>or information sought would cause <b>unwarranted invasion of privacy</b> and PIO/appellate authority is satisfied that there is no larger public interest that justifies disclosure.
</p>
<p>By replacing this with the proposed formulation that personal information would be exempt if it can be shown that disclosure is <b>likely to cause harm </b>and such harm outweighs public interest, the DPB seeks to severely curb the disclosure of information. It is crucial to note that the proposed amendments refer to a mere possibility of harm, rather than a reasonable certainty.
</p>
<p>Further, the definition of the term “harm” which is sought to be applied to section 8 of the RTI law, is very broad. This would have a chilling effect on the RTI Act. The term “harm” is defined as <i>“(i) bodily or mental injury; (ii) loss, distortion or theft of identity; (iii) financial loss or loss of property, (iv) loss of reputation, or humiliation; (v) loss of employment; (vi) any discriminatory treatment (vii) any subjection to blackmail or extortion; (viii) any denial or withdrawal of a service, benefit or good resulting from an evaluative decision about the data principal; (ix) any restriction placed or suffered directly or indirectly on speech, movement or any other action arising out of a fear of being observed or surveilled; or (x) any observation or surveillance that is not reasonably expected by the data principal.”</i>
</p>
<p>Finally, the scope of the public interest test within the proposed section 8(1)(j) appears to have been narrowed, by restricting it primarily to the promotion of transparency and accountability in the functioning of a public authority, as opposed to a more expansive understanding of public interest in terms of upholding constitutional values of social justice, welfare and democratic rights of citizens.
</p>
<p>The proposal to amend the RTI Act through the Data Protection Bill, 2018 appears to have been hastily drafted based on an incorrect understanding of the RTI law. For instance, the Justice Srikrishna committee seems to have erred in interpreting the proviso to section 8(1), which states that “<i>information which cannot be denied to the Parliament or a State Legislature shall not be denied to any person.”</i>, as being only applicable to section 8(1)(j) and not to the whole of section 8(1). A perusal of the original gazette notification of the RTI Act<a href=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/2/#m_-6086216051704750316_m_3530659471583730558_sdfootnote2sym"" class=""m_-6086216051704750316m_3530659471583730558sdfootnoteanc""><sup>2</sup></a> shows that by virtue of its placement and indentation, it is applicable to all of section 8(1) and not merely section 8(1)(j). There are several judicial pronouncements<a href=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/2/#m_-6086216051704750316_m_3530659471583730558_sdfootnote3sym"" class=""m_-6086216051704750316m_3530659471583730558sdfootnoteanc""><sup>3</sup></a> to this effect.
</p>
<p>The amendments proposed to the Right to Information Act, 2005 through the Data Protection Bill, 2018 drafted by the Justice Srikrishna Committee will fundamentally weaken the RTI Act for the reasons highlighted above.
</p>
<p>It is pertinent to note that since the constitution of the Justice Srikrishna Committee, many of us have highlighted our concerns related to the lack of diversity in the composition<a href=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/2/#m_-6086216051704750316_m_3530659471583730558_sdfootnote4sym"" class=""m_-6086216051704750316m_3530659471583730558sdfootnoteanc""><sup>4</sup></a> of the committee and also the lack of transparency<a href=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/2/#m_-6086216051704750316_m_3530659471583730558_sdfootnote5sym"" class=""m_-6086216051704750316m_3530659471583730558sdfootnoteanc""><sup>5</sup></a> in the functioning of the committee. Proper composition of the committee and transparency in its functioning were crucial to ensure that a robust regime for data protection was created without undermining peoples’ right to information.
</p>
<p>We believe that the legal framework for privacy and data protection should complement the RTI Act and in no way undermine or dilute the existing statutory framework that empowers citizens to hold power structures to account. The provisions of the Draft Data Protection Bill need to be suitably amended and harmonized with the provisions and objectives of the RTI Act. This would be in line with the recommendation of the Justice A.P. Shah Report on Privacy (2012) that, <i>“The Privacy Act should clarify that publication of personal data for in public interest, use of personal information for household purposes, and disclosure of information as required by the Right to Information Act should not constitute an infringement of Privacy.”</i>
</p>
<p>Neither the recognition of the Right to Privacy, nor the enactment of a data protection law, requires any amendment to the existing RTI law. We, therefore reject the amendments proposed to the Right to Information Act, 2005 in the Data Protection Bill, 2018 drafted by the Justice Srikrishna Committee

<p>This law allows law enforcement agencies to collect DNA samples, create “DNA profiles” and databanks for criminal investigations. All of this is happening without a credible privacy law in place. We ask, given that a process to make a privacy law is ongoing, what is the tearing hurry make a law to collect our DNA and put them in databanks?</p>
<p>There are several problems with this law which was not put up for public consultation and its final form was never published for stakeholder inputs. Its functionaries have little or no institutional independence or autonomy, it is created at a huge cost of 25 crores (initial outlay) and has no clear provisions for deletion of DNA entries. There are no provisions which inform people how their data will be shared and they will have little to no control over it.

<p><strong>क्या हैं मुख्य खामियां?</strong>
</p>
<ul><li>विधेयक के प्रारूप के अनुसार, डीएनए रेगुलेटरी बोर्ड में किसी ‘विशिष्ट व्यक्ति’ को बोर्ड का उपाध्यक्ष बनाया जा सकता है। इसके अलावा, किसी एक ‘विशेषज्ञ’ को बोर्ड का सदस्य बनाने का प्रावधान भी है। इन दोनों प्रमुख पदों के लिए पात्रता परिभाषित नहीं की गई है, जिससे इसके दुरूपयोग की पूर्ण संभावना है। किसी भी अयोग्य या पक्षपाती व्यक्ति को बोर्ड का उपाध्यक्ष तथा सदस्य बनाया जा सकता है। 
</li><li>यह विधेयक डीएनए डेटा की सुरक्षा और डीएनए धारकों की निजता को किसी भी रूप में सुनिश्चित नहीं करता है। विधेयक का प्रारूप डेटा कलेक्टर्स और डेटा प्रोसेसर्स को डेटा की सुरक्षा करने के लिए किसी भी रूप में बाध्य नहीं करता है। 
</li><li>डीएनए विधेयक डीएनए रेगुलेटरी बोर्ड को व्यापक शक्तियां प्रदान करता है तथा इसे न्यायपालिका के अधिकार क्षेत्र से बाहर रखता है। इससे बोर्ड के अनियंत्रित होने की आशंका बढ़ जाती है। 
</li><li>यह विधेयक डेटा सब्जेक्ट्स (जिनके डीएनए का डेटा संकलित किया गया है) को यह जानने का अधिकार प्रदान नहीं करता है कि किस-किस ने, कौन से कार्यों के लिए, किन रूपों में उनके डेटा का प्रयोग किया है। इसका अर्थ यह है कि एक बार डीएनए डेटा के संकलित होने पर यह अनियंत्रित रूप से विभिन्न एजेंसियों तथा व्यक्तियों की पहुँच में आ जायेगा। 
</li><li>विधेयक के प्रावधानों के अनुसार, डीएनए डेटा सब्जेक्ट्स को डेटा के उपयोग होने के बाद उसे मिटाने अथवा नष्ट करने का अधिकार भी नहीं प्रदान किया गया है। डेटा के एक बार रिकॉर्ड हो जाने पर इसे कितने भी समय के लिए रखा जा सकता है। 
</li></ul><p><strong>इस बिल का विरोध क्यों करें? </strong>
</p>
<ul><li>यह विधेयक डीएनए जैसी संवेदनशील डेटा को संकलित करता है जिससे व्यक्ति की प्रोफाइलिंग की जा सकती है। डीएनए से व्यक्ति के रंग-रूप के अलावा उसके गुणदोषों तथा शारीरिक विवरण का भी पता लगाया जा सकता है। इसके अलावा, इसके पारित होने पर आधार की तरह एक बड़ा डेटाबेस बन जाएगा जिसका किसी भी रूप में दुरूपयोग किया जा सकता है। 
</li><li>इसके अलावा, यह विधेयक केवल डीएनए की ही नहीं, बल्कि अन्य संवेदनशील जानकारियां जैसे जाति और लिंग की भी जानकारियां संकलित और संग्रहित करने का अधिकार प्रदान करता है। 
</li><li>यह विधेयक निजता को किसी भी रूप में सुनिश्चित नहीं करता है और सुप्रीम कोर्ट के उस फैसले के विरुद्ध है जिसमे सुप्रीम कोर्ट ने निजता के अधिकार की व्याख्या मौलिक अधिकार के रूप में की थी। 
</li><li>विधेयक का प्रारूप लॉ कमीशन के पुराने तथा समस्यात्मक रिपोर्ट पर आधारित है। यह रिपोर्ट सुप्रीम कोर्ट के निजता के मौलिक अधिकार के फैसले के पहले आई थी। अर्थात, डीएनए विधेयक का वर्त्तमान समय में कोई औचित्य नहीं है तथा कानूनी रूप से भी व्यवहार्य भी नहीं है।
</li><li>वर्त्तमान समय में भारत डेटा सुरक्षा तथा निजता का कानून पारित करवाने की दहलीज पर है। ऐसे समय में यदि डीएनए विधेयक पारित हो जाता है, तो यह डेटा सुरक्षा बिल के प्रावधानों के बिल्कुल विपरीत होगा। ऐसे में सरकार दो विरोधाभासी विधेयकों पर एक साथ कैसे काम कर सकती है? 
</li><li>इस विधेयक का प्रारूप तैयार करते समय जनता की कोई राय नहीं मांगी गई थी। इसके अलावा, इसे पास करवाने के लिए डीएनए व्यापर से जुड़ी बहुत सी बहुराष्ट्रीय कंपनियां लॉबिंग कर रही हैं। गॉर्डोन हनीवेल जैसी कंपनियां - जिनका डीएनए किट बेंचने का बड़ा कारोबार है, लॉबिंग कर रही हैं जिससे यह विधेयक पास हो और वह सरकार को भारी मात्रा में वे डीएनए किट बेंच पाए।

</p>
<p>While the answer is fairly obvious, it will be better understood with analysis that is divided in three parts.
</p>
<p>The first documents the history of interception given the narrative that, “no new powers have been conferred” by the recent Ministry of Home Affairs <a href=""https://www.scribd.com/document/396098046/MHA-Notification#from_embed"">order</a>. The second marks how surveillance works at present and the incumbent problems. In conclusion, this piece examines the government response and prompts a thought on the needed solution. To properly understand the Ministry of Home Affairs order, one has to step back in time to look at the riveting history of surveillance reform that emerges from tales of political intrigue.
</p>
<h2>How it all started</h2>
<p>Due to the fractious politics of the early 1990s, politician and former prime minister Chandra Shekhar accused the VP Singh government of <a href=""https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/special-report/story/19900430-chandra-shekhars-phone-tapping-charges-kicks-up-a-major-controversy-812527-1990-04-30"">illegal phone tapping of opponents.</a> These disclosures led to India’s pre-eminent human rights organisation the People’s Union for Civil Liberties approaching the Supreme Court. It was discovered that no procedure, or even proper safeguards existed for telephone tapping.
</p>
<p>The court laid down certain guidelines in its <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/31276692/"">decision in 1996</a>. During arguments, there was a specific suggestion for judicial oversight, which was rejected. These guidelines became an important marker that must be examined in the context of that time - keeping in mind the prevalent technology, then a fixed-line telephone, and the volume, nature and extent of personal information. The court’s guidelines were later formally placed in the Telegraph Rules with the insertion of <a href=""http://www.dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/march2007.pdf?download=1"">Rule 419-A</a>. This became the operative structure for telephone tapping.
</p>
<h2>Systemic Rot</h2>
<p>Over the years, these guidelines have proved to be ineffective. Phone tapping scandals continued to arise, pointing to design faults – ranging from the lack of independent oversight of interceptions, to agencies which were not under any parliamentary supervision or control. Incidents, such as allegations made by <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1082001/"">Amar Singh</a> or the <a href=""http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=71791"">Radia Tapes</a>, evidenced a systemic rot but they were limited to political personalities, or sometimes industrial espionage, and the popular argument for surveillance reform lacked a broader constituency. There were also counter arguments of state security and anti-terrorism measures made in support of surveillance.
</p>
<p>Repeated calls for reform have been made over the years. The <a href=""http://planningcommission.nic.in/reports/genrep/rep_privacy.pdf"">Justice AP Shah Committee on Privacy</a> included recommendations on this issue and the Department of Personnel and Training even commenced an exercise to draft a comprehensive Privacy Act which (as per leaked versions) included such reforms. However, till date there have been hardly any meaningful changes in India’s government surveillance framework to check abuse and to protect individual rights.
</p>
<p>As per India’s<a href=""https://www.trai.gov.in/notifications/press-release/press-release-indian-telecom-services-performance-indicator-report-20""> telecom regulator, </a>about four in ten Indians today has a smartphone. These devices are a passport to the digital world that is making our lives better via pervasive data gathering. This knowledge exchange is not only conducted by large global online platforms but also government services. The amount of personal information available on handheld devices today is unhindered by technical capability or even economic cost as data storage and acquisition costs continue to drop. Economically and socially, personal data, is not the new ‘oil’ as many have put it, it is <a href=""https://apargupta.com/data-is-not-oil-it-is-power-559442369ec5"">power</a> over the way people think, act and function.
</p>
<h2>New rules, old abuse</h2>
<p>The <a href=""http://meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Information%20Technology%20%28Procedure%20and%20Safeguards%20for%20Interception%2C%20Monitoring%20and%20Decryption%20of%20Information%29%20Rules%2C%202009.pdf"">rules for digital surveillance</a> were made in 2009 by the Central Government and included a specific power under Section 69 of the Information Technology Act.
</p>
<p>Though this power had existed since 2000, when parliament first legislated the IT Act, its scope was expanded by an <a href=""http://nagapol.gov.in/PDF/IT%20Act%20(Amendments)2008.pdf"">amendment in 2008</a>. These changes and the 2009 rules focused on data acquisition from large online platforms which serve as digital honeypots for governments. The rules are closely modeled on the telephone tapping framework and follow a similar model – but they extend it further in terms of power.
</p>
<p>For instance they permit surveillance in terms of monitoring data traffic of an individual or class of persons, or relating to any subject and via more than one computer resource. The IT rules claim constitutionality in the Supreme Court decision in the 1997 telephone tapping case, which did consider an expanded spectrum of personal data acquisition.
</p>
<p>There are deviations but in contrast with the telephone tapping and the digital snooping rules, it is a clear inference that the scope of power and acquisition of personal information is deeper, wider and pervasive. Digital snooping pierces the skull into the range of human emotion, it cuts to the bone to the mildest kinesis of physical action.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the safeguards are extremely deficient and bear the same design flaws of the telephone tapping architecture. The agencies who should be tasked with surveillance have still not been created by parliamentary enactments, there is concentration of power in the executive branch and illegally gathered data is admissible as evidence in court cases as there is no necessity for judicial warrants. Little or no safeguards exist as recommended most notably by the Justice AP Shah Committee report on privacy.
</p>
<h2>A weak defence by the Government</h2>
<p>On Friday, when a political maelstrom broke out, the Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs made a spirited defence which deserves some examination to understand the path ahead. Elements of this defence were contained in the <a href=""http://164.100.47.5/newdebate/247/21122018/14.00pmTo15.00pm.pdf"">parliamentary reply</a>, <a href=""https://www.arunjaitley.com/the-congress-speaks-without-thinking/"">a blog post</a>, and a clarification issued through a <a href=""http://www.pib.nic.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1556945"">press statement</a> by the Ministry of Home Affairs. Let’s look at it threadbare from the point of legality and accuracy rather than apportioning blame to political parties.
</p>
<p><strong>The first point</strong> is that the <a href=""https://www.bloombergquint.com/politics/government-allows-10-central-agencies-to-monitor-decrypt-any-computer-data#gs.0na9CZA"">notification</a>, that authorises 10 central agencies to intercept, monitor and decrypt all data contained in any computer, is only a continuation of past practice. It is routine and has been followed even prior to 2009. This omits to consider that the earlier powers and requisition of personal information for telephone tapping were limited as compared to the expanse of digital snooping. It also does not consider that the notification, a fresh one, infact activates 2009 rules - as no earlier such notification existed to empower intelligence agencies. What was pre-existing were notifications for telephone tapping under Rule 419-A of the Telegraph Rules. This is a new development even if the context for it was created years ago.
</p>
<p><strong>The second point</strong> - that the notification is necessary for protecting individual rights, as, without it, police officers were acting beyond the purview of law. It bears repetition, that, if they were, any such action was unconstitutional. Without authority, such interception, monitoring and decryption could not be carried out itself. Hence when viewed holistically the MHA notification activates broad powers in favour of ten central agencies to send requisitions to the Ministry of Home Affairs. It ultimately is a fresh development which tremendously expands their powers from tapping telephones to fine grains of our digital data.
</p>
<p><strong>The third</strong> justification was that this notification was necessary for intelligence agencies to prevent acts of terrorism. There is little quarrel here with the objective. Terrorism hurts people and we need to secure our country. What is in dispute is the proportionality of the legal power to achieve these objectives. Only in August, 2017, nine judges of the Supreme Court laid down an authoritati<a href=""https://www.sci.gov.in/pdf/LU/ALL%20WP(C)%20No.494%20of%202012%20Right%20to%20Privacy.pdf""> judgment on the right to privacy </a>whose majority opinion stresses on heightened safeguards for individuals and tougher scrutiny for officials. Even the majority <a href=""https://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/supremecourt/2012/35071/35071_2012_Judgement_26-Sep-2018.pdf"">Aadhaar decision,</a> which came as a disappointment for many activists, recognises the role of judicial warrants which require a judge’s signature. This is in recognition that the telephone tapping safeguards may be proper in 1996 as per the court. However, times have changed. Legal doctrine has evolved to recognise that a smartphone requires a smarter approach and safeguards to surveillance.
</p>
<p>Hence, rather than reviewing the 2009 rules, the government activated them. This was not a continuation of a past practice, but a fresh one which expanded previous abuse. Even if the notification is just a continuation of past practice, it has perpetuated a broken system prone to abuse.
</p>
<p>The government’s approach is not surprising, given that the the Ministry of Electronics and IT is considering the Justice BN Srikrishna drafted <a href=""https://www.prsindia.org/sites/default/files/bill_files/Draft%20Personal%20Data%20Protection%20Bill%2C%202018%20Draft%20Text.pdf"">Draft Data Protection Bill</a> that does not pose any legal intervention on surveillance. A <a href=""http://meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Data_Protection_Committee_Report.pdf"">separate report </a>authored by them disingenuously hides behind incoherent arguments and legal doctrine in marking this task to a separate initiative, ignoring the practical reality of threat to privacy arising both from the private and the public spheres of data gathering.
</p>
<p><strong>What is the fix?</strong>
</p>
<p>It is a comprehensive privacy law such as the <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/bill"">Indian Privacy Code</a>. The MHA notification is only one in a range of government programs, many which we do not fully know about, that are building surveillance capabilities. These will no longer target those who wield or aspire for power, but more ordinary people, minorities and the poor who lack resources to safeguard themselves. As concerned citizens, while there may be many versions of the specific minutiae of legality, it should be our common claim that data protection is incomplete without surveillance reform.
</p>
<p>Without, it India will become a surveillance state. We will keep pushing to #SaveOurPrivacy. Watch this space for more....

Why is it being done secretly? Why are you not being involved? We first explain what these rules do, then pose the top five concerns for users in a rule by rule analysis.</p>
<p><b>What are the intermediary rules?</b>
 </p>
<p>Called the <a href=""http://meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/GSR314E_10511%281%29_0.pdf"">Intermediary Rules, 2011</a>, they are drafted under the Information Technology Act, 2000 that provides immunity to online platforms and internet service providers for content which is transmitted and published by end users. This immunity allows these conduits of information to facilitate free expression and prevents them from throttling content or implementing overbroad censorship – which could lead to a “chilling effect”. In return, they have to comply with legal requests for takedown of content and providing information on users – basically comply with the law. This was a principle recognised in Section 79 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (as amended in 2008).</p>
<p>But principal legislations such as Section 79 leave the details to subordinate rules. This is exactly what the Intermediary Rules, 2011 are, which were made after <a href=""https://iltb.net/comments-on-draft-intermediaries-guidelines-2011-1cdfd4d53bc2"">public consultation</a> in March, 2011. There was a dispute on how this consultation was carried out, but still the draft rules were published online and comments on it were invited by the Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. However, these rules were unclear and vague. For instance, they did not clearly state what was “actual knowledge” of content being illegal from the point of view of a platform (such as Facebook). Due to this in the <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/110813550/"">Shreya Singhal case</a> (which struck down as unconstitutional section 66A of Information Technology Act, that <a href=""https://scroll.in/article/778939/five-court-judgements-from-2015-that-left-a-lasting-imprint-on-india"">placed broad curbs</a> on online content), the Supreme Court said that “actual knowledge” came only when platforms received a legal notice from the police or a court, not from private parties.
 </p>
<p>So what is being changed now? And what is at stake?
 </p>
<p><b>Five top concerns</b>
 </p>
<ol><li><b>On process:</b> First, let us start with how these draft rules are being made. This is a serious development and is eerily reminiscent of the calls for <a href=""https://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/06/any-normal-human-being-would-be-offended/"">“pre-censorship”</a> made in December, 2011. As reported by the <i>Indian Express</i> the process is closed, being held between officials of the Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and a handful of large social media and messaging companies, who have been allowed to submit comments by January 7. But the changes, as we go on to explain, will impact users like you and me; it will impact our right to privacy and freedom of speech and expression. Why then is the public being kept out?
 </li><li><b>Breaking encryption: </b>Draft rule, 3(5) introduces the requirement of traceability which would break end-to-end encryption.Many platforms (Whatsapp, Signal, Telegram etc) retain minimal user data for electronic information exchange and also deploy end-to-end encryption to provide reliability, security and privacy to users. These are used by millions of Indians to prevent identity theft and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_injection""></a>. Encryption becomes more important as more of life now involves our personal data. Without thought or involving technical experts in an open consultative process, without any data protection law or surveillance reform, this is being tinkered with by introducing the requirement of “traceability”.Breaking encryption also has important consequences for everyday users of online services. It should also be seen in the context of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs notification on Thursday which <a href=""https://scroll.in/article/906579/home-ministry-order-on-computer-surveillance-is-not-new-upa-introduced-provisions-in-2008"">&gt;span class=""s1""&gt;activated</a> a 2008 rule that holds the power to enforce decryption of online content. We do not have any proper parliamentary oversight or judicial check on surveillance and the latest draft rules, if they go through, would be a tremendous expansion in the power of the government over ordinary citizens, eerily reminiscent of China’s blocking and breaking of user encryption to surveil its citizens.
 </li><li><b>Longer, even indefinite, data retention</b>: Draft Rule 3(8) increases the data retention period from 90 to 180 days and provides for further retention on the discretion of “government agencies”. The phrase “government agencies” is not defined and the specific conditions or any outer time limit for data retention is not provided. Hence, using a mere letter, a government department can require a private platform to store a user’s data indefinitely, without even letting the user know. It is important to remember that such retention can continue even if the user deletes his data on the servers of the intermediary platform.
 </li><li><b>Pro-active censorship:</b> Draft Rule 3(9) is the most dangerous bit which would be a sledgehammer to free speech online. Not limited to abuse, harassment or threats but even legitimate speech could be suppressed by requiring online platforms to become pro-active arbiters and judges of legality. Placing such a requirement on a platform for it to obtain immunity from prosecution and actively sweep its platform would result in widespread takedowns without any legal process or natural justice. This violates the reasoning of the Shreya Singhal judgement which noted, “it would be very difficult for intermediaries like Google, Facebook etc. to act when millions of requests are made and the intermediary is then to judge as to which of such requests are legitimate and which are not.” It shifts the duty of the state to a private party.What is worse is that it will be done by “technology based automated tools or appropriate mechanisms”. Such tools have been shown to be <a href=""https://freedex.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/2015/files/2018/10/AI-and-FOE-GA.pdf"">faulty, have coding biases and prone to overbroad censorship</a>. Should we subject our fundamental right to free speech on the basis of a not-yet-fully-developed technology? Artificial intelligence censorship is the <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/9728b178-59b4-11e8-bdb7-f6677d2e1ce8"">Chinese model of censorship</a>.
 </li><li><b>The nanny requirement:</b> Draft Rule 3(4), inserts a monthly requirement (at the least) to inform users about legal requirements such as the terms and conditions and privacy policy. At first blush this may seem a needed measure, given rampant online abuse and trolling. But consider the change in the environment from a public park to a guarded school yard in which you are constantly reminded that you are under watch and you better behave yourself. It will turn the internet in India into a corporal environment which is bad for users. Rather than letting market mechanisms figure out norms for good conduct, which is in the best interests of platforms themselves, such a measure by law will require product-side changes for smaller startups and entrepreneurs as well.
 </li></ol><p>We believe there are better ways to check misinformation and threats to Indian democracy. These can be achieved as per our fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution. These proposals when seen alongside the recent Union Ministry of Home Affairs notification activating the 2009 interception rules are taking India closer to a Chinese model of censorship. Yes, online platforms are problematic, they do require fixes. But driving changes through a closed and secretive process using measures that undermine fundamental rights is a harmful approach for all of us.
 </p>
<p>To us, the path to battle disinformation is clear: pass a comprehensive privacy law. This will help bring accountability to large data controllers, from online companies which target us with advertising, to political parties.
</p><p><br /></p><p>Update: The Ministry of Electronics and IT has announced a, ""public consultation"" on the Draft Rules. It has invited comments till Jan. 15, 2019. However, we are somewhat reticent on this given that this is seeming as an afterthought and our past experience with the same ministry on its lack of transparency. </p>",
12263,"The Aadhaar Amendment Bill contravenes the Supreme Court Judgement on Surveillance",the-aadhaar-amendment-bill-contravenes-the-supreme-court-judgement-on-surveillance,,,admin,2019-01-03,,Yes,live,"Apar Gupta","<p>Yesterday on January 2, 2019 the Minister for Electronics and IT, Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad <a href=""http://164.100.47.193/lob/16/XVI/LOB2.12.2018.pdf"">introduced</a> the <a href=""https://prsindia.org/billtrack/aadhaar-and-other-laws-amendment-bill-2018"">Aadhaar Amendment Bill, 2018</a> in the Lok Sabha. This Aadhaar Amendment Bill is a legislative follow up to the <a href=""https://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/supremecourt/2012/35071/35071_2012_Judgement_26-Sep-2018.pdf"">judgement of the Supreme Court</a> on the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Program where several directions were given and parts of the <a href=""https://uidai.gov.in/images/the_aadhaar_act_2016.pdf"">Aadhaar Act, 2016</a> were declared unconstitutional. The proposed amendments specifically on the point of surveillance are in clear contravention of Supreme Court directions and even may be a stratagem to circumvent it as we explain below.</p>
<p><b>Background to the Aadhaar amendment</b>
</p>
<p>While we understand the need for a legislative amendment, there are questions on the timing of this legislative proposal where it has come close to the winter break, and has been done without any public consultation. These concerns are leading to many worrying that the Aadhaar Amendment Bill is being “bulldozed” without adequate transparency or public feedback on the wider problems with the programme itself. For a more holistic assessment we invite our readers to check with the updates over at the, “Rethink Aadhaar” campaign who also have put up a <a href=""https://rethinkaadhaar.in/blog/2019/1/1/government-violating-sc-orders-by-introducing-amendments-for-commercial-use-of-aadhaar"">specific post on it</a>. 
</p>
<p>Limiting ourselves to the aspect of surveillance, it is proper to look at Section 33 of the Aadhaar Act, 2016. This provision contemplated the sharing of Aadhaar data in two conditions and is pasted below. In sub-section 33(1) it contemplated when the sharing occurs on a direction by a district judge, and in sub-section 33(2) when it is done by an order at the level of a “joint secretary” to the Government of India. 
</p>
<p><i>Section 33.-- Disclosure of information in certain cases.</i>
</p>
<p><i>(1) Nothing contained in sub-section (2) or sub-section (5) of section 28 or sub-section (2) of section 29 shall apply in respect of any disclosure of information, including identity information or authentication records, made pursuant to an order of a court not inferior to that of a District Judge: Provided that no order by the court under this sub-section shall be made without giving an opportunity of hearing to the Authority. </i>
</p>
<p><i>(2) Nothing contained in sub-section (2) or sub-section (5) of section 28 and clause (b) of sub-section (1), sub-section (2) or sub-section (3) of section 29 shall apply in respect of any disclosure of information, including identity information or authentication records, made in the interest of national security in pursuance of a direction of an officer not below the rank of Joint Secretary to the Government of India specially authorised in this behalf by an order of the Central Government: </i>
</p>
<p><i>Provided that every direction issued under this sub-section, shall be reviewed by an Oversight Committee consisting of the Cabinet Secretary and the Secretaries to the Government of India in the Department of Legal Affairs and the Department of Electronics and Information Technology, before it takes effect: </i>
</p>
<p><i>Provided further that any direction issued under this sub-section shall be valid for a period of three months from the date of its issue, which may be extended for a further period of three months after the review by the Oversight Committee.</i>
</p>
<p><b>Judgement of the Supreme Court</b>
</p>
<p>The<a href=""https://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/supremecourt/2012/35071/35071_2012_Judgement_26-Sep-2018.pdf""> Supreme Court judgement</a> on Aadhaar is split into three opinions, and for our purposes owe are only using the Judgement of Justice A.K. Sikri which forms the operative directions. The specific findings on Section 33 are contained in paragraph below: 
</p>
<p>Page 545
</p>
<p><i>“(iii) </i><i>Section 33(1)</i><i> of the Aadhaar Act is read down by clarifying that an individual, whose information is sought to be released, </i>shall be afforded an opportunity of hearing<i>. </i>
</p>
<p><i>(iv) Insofar as </i><i>Section 33(2)</i><i> of the Act in the present form is concerned, the same is </i><i>struck down</i><i>.”</i>
</p>
<p>Page 558
</p>
<p><i>“(e) </i><i>Section 33(1)</i><i> of the Act prohibits disclosure of information, including identity information or authentication records, except when it is by an order of a court not inferior to that of a District Judge. </i><i>We have held that this provision is to be read down with the clarification that an individual, whose information is sought to be released, shall be afforded an opportunity of hearing.</i><i> If such an order is passed, in that eventuality, he shall also have right to challenge such an order passed by approaching the higher court. During the hearing before the concerned court, the said individual can always object to the disclosure of information on accepted grounds in law, including Article 20(3) of the Constitution or the privacy rights etc.</i>
</p>
<p><i>(f) Insofar as </i><i>Section 33(2) </i><i>is concerned, it is held that disclosure of information in the interest of national security cannot be faulted with. However, for determination of such an eventuality, an officer higher than the rank of a Joint Secretary should be given such a power. </i><i>Further, in order to avoid any possible misuse, a Judicial Officer (preferably a sitting High Court Judge) should also be associated with. </i><i>We may point out that such provisions of application of judicial mind for arriving at the conclusion that disclosure of information is in the interest of national security, are prevalent in some jurisdictions. In view thereof, Section 33(2) of the Act in the present form is struck down with liberty to enact a suitable provision on the lines suggested above.”</i>
</p>
<p>It becomes clear from the above that changes are required in both sub-sections. With Section 33(1) requiring the opportunity of a hearing prior to a judge ordering disclosure; and Section 33(2) requiring that not only an officer higher than the rank of a Joint Secretary ordering the sharing of Aadhaar data, but the oversight of a high court judge. Now let us look how does the Aadhaar Amendment Bill, 2018 deal with it.
</p>
<p><b>Aadhaar Amendment Bill, 2018 circumvents the SC Decision</b>
</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://prsindia.org/sites/default/files/bill_files/Aadhaar%20Bill%2C%202018.pdf"">Aadhaar Amendment Bill, 2018</a> ostensibly seeks to comply with the Supreme Court judgement on surveillance but does very little to provide safeguards and protections as directed by it. In clause 12 of the Amendment Bill the changes to Section 33 of the Aadhaar Act, 2016 are proposed. It is important here to concentrate on Section 33(2) which deals with executive orders which form the bulk of information sharing requests in forms of interception of surveillance. The reason being that intelligence bodies source their information requests through the the Central Government rather than through courts. 
</p>
<p>Here the amendment, to subsection 33(2) only seeks to replace the functionary with the substitution of the word, “Joint Secretary” to, “Secretary”. Hence, there is still no judicial oversight as directed by the Supreme Court judgement. The centralisation of surveillance powers without any checks and balances has been criticised in several analysis such as by <a href=""http://nujslawreview.org/2016/12/04/pucl-v-union-of-india-revisited-why-indias-surveillance-law-must-be-revised-for-the-digital-age/"">Chaitanya Ramachandran</a> and in a <a href=""http://macrofinance.nipfp.org.in/PDF/BBPR2018-Use-of-personal-data.pdf"">separate paper</a> by Rishab Bailey, Vrinda Bhandari, Smriti Parsheera, Faiza Rahman. 
</p>
<p>This omission by the Aadhaar Amendment Bill, 2018 is not casual or an oversight and speaks to the larger trend with the MHA notification authorising 10 intelligence and police agencies to conduct digital surveillance, and the proposed intermediary guidelines which seek to break encryption with traceability. It also is telling of the legislative priorities where there is no movement on the Government’s flawed, inadequate Data Protection Bill. This proposed legislation in addition to lacking a clear legislative roadmap and now looking as an afterthought is also substantially deficient as it does not contain provisions for judicial oversight for surveillance. 
</p>
<p>We at #SaveOurPrivacy are campaigning for an alternative that protects you and also balances the state interest in your protection and safety. Our draft law, which we have termed the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 contains a well thought and developed proposal for surveillance reform that requires judicial involvement along with the data protection authority. Without such a law, as we have stated before India runs the risk of turning into a surveillance state.

<ul><li>First, MIETY must respect the fundamental rights of internet users and treat them as the primary stakeholders in this conversation. This flows specifically from according respect to the Shreya Singhal judgement, which not only struck down Section 66A as unconstitutional (<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/iffs-supports-seeking-a-stop-to-66a-cases-righttomeme-section66a/"">which is not being complied with</a>), but also according due respect to its directions on intermediary liability. Further, MIETY must act on the findings of the Committee on Subordinate Legislation to the 15th Lok Sabha which required changes to the Intermediary Rules to reduce vagueness. 
</li><li>Second, most of the changes suggested are beyond the jurisdiction of MEITY. It must also remember the limited jurisdictional ambit as this present exercise is to change rules which can only be framed within the confine of the parent provision that is Section 79. Hence, making prescriptions for, introducing traceability that breaks encryption, automated filtering of user content or prohibiting the display of content such as vaping devices falls outside its jurisdictional mandate and results in further vagueness. 
</li><li>Third, to secure the fundamental rights of users the approach to take towards online intermediaries should start with meaningful transparency and accountability. Here, it is important for the public to know the processes, standards and internal decision making followed especially by large social media platforms. MIETY must urgently commence this process by requiring such disclosures that are made public on grounds of safeguarding the privacy and speech of millions of users who use the internet today. 
</li><li>Fourth, the CRAC (Cyber Regulations Advisory Committee) which is a statutory body under the Information Technology Act, 2000 should be reconstituted with prominent membership of civil society organisations and should be tasked with coming up with a white paper on the future of the Information Technology Act, 2000. We believe that rather than diluting intermediary liability which requires to be safeguarded further protections to internet users is necessary.

<p>We called to attention the risks this poses to our online privacy saying that it enable surveillance without any transparency or oversight. It lacks any meaningful safeguards. These arguments are at the center of the case filed by IFF which is challenging the legality of the digital surveillance system before the Supreme Court of India. 
</p>
<p>In order to get to the bottom of this order and do something about it, IFF filed six RTIs seeking answers to the following rather basic questions:
</p>
<ol><li>How many times has the government used its powers for interception?
</li><li>How many agencies have been authorized to intercept, monitor or decrypt data?
</li><li>The names and the directions provided to the abovementioned agencies.
</li><li>Date, time and duration of meetings conducted by the Review Committee.
</li><li>How many times has the government received requests from different agencies seeking interception?
<ol><li>Number of requests denied
</li><li>Number of requests approved
</li></ol></li><li>How many times has an order been issued to prevent any offence which affects the sovereignty, integrity, defence or security of the state?
<ol><li>Number of times order issued to investigate into an offence
</li></ol></li></ol><p>According to us, these are very reasonable questions which help us understand how surveillance practices are implemented in India. Their disclosure which is primarily to infer broad operational trends and the implementation of safeguards and they would in no way impact national security. 
</p>
<p>Well to our disappointment all six RTIs were rejected. The grounds cited are sections 8(1)(a), 8(1)(g) and 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act 2005 on the grounds that ‘Disclosure of information related to lawful interception/phone tapping/monitor or decrypt is exempted’. This basically means that the government is unwilling to tell us who has access to all our private data and why they have access to it. If anything this reply confirmed was the complete secrecy and lack of oversight in digital surveillance by the Government of our personal data. 
</p>
<p>Next steps? We will be filing an appeal against this denial and pursuing these RTIs to their logical conclusion. </p>
<p>We would also like to indicate that RTI Activist, Mr. Venkatesh Nayak (Coordinator, Access to Information, Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative) has filed similar RTIs and received a similar rejection. He has recently penned a legal analysis on it <a href=""https://theleaflet.in/computers-intercepted-transparency-interrupted-mhas-cpio-refuses-information-about-december-2018-authorisation-order-under-the-it-act"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">at the Leaflet</a>.</p>

12349,"Privacy for the young. A personal perspective.",privacy-for-the-young-a-personal-perspective,,,admin,2019-02-12,,Yes,live,"Tanvi Vipra","<p>The concept of privacy is very different for a young person and online privacy even more so than what people would normally imagine it to be. I belong to a generation that grew up with technology and as a first year undergraduate student it is an indispensable part of my life. It is nearly impossible to not have an online presence in today’s age which is why it becomes extremely important to make sure that a person’s privacy is protected in this domain. But what exactly does privacy mean in a digital world? And what does it mean to a generation whose entire life is virtually on social media platforms?</p>
<p>It may be thought that because young people tend to overshare details of their lives on social media platforms, they do not value privacy. But this is not true. Studies have shown quite the opposite 1 and I can say from personal experience that I value my online privacy just as much as an older person might. The only difference that lies is in how we define privacy. Maintaining privacy in a digital space does not necessarily mean leading a private life. The concept of online privacy is a very nuanced one and it needs to be understood if we are to defend it.
</p>
<p>Suppose I am on a social media platform like Reddit or Twitter, I may have no problem with admitting to 300+ strangers that I have clinical depression. But I would like to maintain my anonymity, not just from the users of Reddit or Twitter but also from the platforms themselves. Privacy is also very contextual. Consider the same example. When I post information about having clinical depression on a public platform it is because I am seeking help and relatability from people who might be in similar situations. 
</p>
<p>Just because I have put it in a public platform does not mean that I am okay with my friends and family finding out about it. Thus one piece of information about me can be public in a different context and be private in a different context. For instance, featured below is a picture of me feeling warm because of the office heater. I would post this my social media but I wouldn’t want my co-workers knowing that I was hogging the office heater. Or bragging about hogging it.</p><img src=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Screenshot-2019-02-12-at-3.20.04-PM.png"" alt=""Roasty, toasty."" title=""Roasty, toasty."" />Roasty, toasty. <p><br /></p><p>This is also true about a person’s behaviour on the internet. My friends or followers might know which pages I follow, what posts I like, what political ideology I have, what products I use, what commute I use and even what I had for lunch. But when this data and more is aggregated and used to build a character profile by service providers, I object. 
</p>
<p>When all this data exists separately it may not worry me so much, but when it is aggregated, analysed and processed and I am subject to targeted content, it worries me. It worries me because this data can very easily be used against me if it falls in the wrong hands. Moreover, the data becomes even more dangerous if it falls in the hands of the government because it becomes increasingly easy to suppress any dissenting voices. 
</p>
<p>For legal purposes I may have consented to my data being used and even being sold to third parties, but that consent is taken at such a juncture where I don’t have any other option but to ‘Accept’ the terms and conditions because the other option is to not use that service. At that point the consent does not hold much value because of the lack of options. I believe that privacy of individuals must be respected in the digital realm and real consent must be taken for using consumer data.

12395,"The individual must be at the center of privacy protection",the-individual-must-be-at-the-center-of-privacy-protection,,,admin,2019-02-25,,Yes,live,"Tanvi Vipra","<p>The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, MEITY for short has drafted a Personal Data Protection Bill which is likely to be tabled in the parliament this June. We have some concerns over the drafting of the bill, which you can read<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/the-drafting-process-for-the-data-protection-bill-should-not-be-shrouded-in-secrecy-saveourprivacy/""> here</a>, but more importantly we are worried about the principles that form the basis of the bill.<br /></p>
<p>We believe that the rights of an individual are equally important as the rights of corporates, government bodies, startups etc. But when it comes to privacy rights and data protection we strongly feel that an individual must be at the centre. Simply put, we believe that an individual’s right to privacy comes before a business’s wish to innovate, expand and contribute to the economy [digital economy?]. It may seem like common sense to some people, but to others, it may be shocking. After all, what happened to principles of equality? 
</p>
<p>Well, firstly a person’s right to privacy is a fundamental right and as observed by the Supreme Court bench which passed the privacy order, it is intrinsic to a person’s Right to Life. So naturally, we should value this over corporate desire of growth and profit. Moreover, B.R. Ambedkar, while drafting the Constitution observed that an individual is an end in himself. This idea resonates throughout our Constitution and therefore must reflect in any new laws that are passed, especially ones that affect the people directly.
</p>
<p>It must also be kept in mind that an individual does not have the resources that corporations have at his disposal to protect himself. While it is true that the state machinery exists to serve the individual but even a well functioning system would be of no use if a law directly states that fundamental rights are to be given less importance over the digital economy.
</p>
<p>Consider the current situation where large businesses constantly breach user privacy for self interest. By businesses, we are mainly referring to digital platforms that provide services such as social networking, shopping, food or ride sharing. They claim that without this data of their users (personal data which is taken with a fabricated consent), their innovation will be restricted and this will hamper the digital economy. For them, regulation acts as an unnecessary hindrance for growth and exploration.
</p>
<p>Meity has referred to this problem extensively in the draft bill. It has laid out the main problem as a tradeoff between innovation and data protection. But this is not the correct way to address a problem. Regardless of what classical economists keep telling you, not everything in life is a tradeoff. It is not necessary that innovation and subsequently, the digital economy’s growth will be hampered if we protect user privacy. In fact experts and lawmakers must create a framework where the two coexist, and not just coexist but also supplement each other.
</p>
<p>If we talk about data protection, the most common thing we have heard everywhere is that ‘data is the new oil’. But we strongly disagree. Data cannot be the new oil and it should not be treated as such. An important step towards understanding the logic that dismisses this argument of data being the new is to contextualise our understanding of data. When we use the word data, it brings to mind a very vague association of numbers and databases. But the data that we are talking about is personal data. Likes and dislikes of people, their behaviour on the internet, their shopping decisions, their politics and even their intimate details. When this personal data is seen as a resource, ready to be exploited for corporate benefit, we reduce an individual’s identity to a resource. This should not be an acceptable practice while securing the constitutional rights of people.
</p>
<p>People should not be seen as resources and their rights must not be secured based on how useful they prove to be but because of the fact that they are people. This is why it becomes so important to advocate for rights of individuals. Although these rights are being secured in the Constitution, we must make sure that they are upheld in every subsequent law, otherwise the principles upon which the Constitution is built will no longer hold value.</p>

This timeline coincides with the proposed amendments to the draft Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2018.</p>
<p>All this may seem like dull, legal mumbo-jumbo (<em>which it often is</em>); however these legal changes and proposals has a real, direct and severe impact on your privacy. When we launched the #SaveOurPrivacy campaign we made a public commitment to you, to keep fighting to ensure it is protected and over the past few months we have kept busy serving it! <br /></p>
<p>Here's a few highlights to catch up with what we've been stirring:</p>
<p><strong>1. Public Engagement and informing analysis</strong>: We have continuously engaged not only through our submissions to public consultations but through our posts that summarise these issues with explainers. </p>
<ul><li>Aadhaar Amendment: We have been coordinating with our friends over at the, ""Rethink Aadhaar"" campaign. This includes spending time in devising strategy, lending resources, collaboration to increase visibility. </li><li>Intermediaries Rules: Some proposed changes to these rules will restrict not only your freedom of speech and expression but by measures such as breaking encryption, endanger your right to privacy (<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/we-urge-meity-to-press-reboot-on-the-intermediary-rules-saveourprivacy-righttomeme/"">Read about it here</a>).</li><li>The Draft Personal Data Protection Bill: This proposed law may be introduced in the present session of parliament. It contains various gaps that need addressing before it is turned into legislation ranging from a number of exceptions provided to the Government to the lack of provisions that deal with surveillance reform and protection of children online (<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/saveourprivacy-initial-statement-on-justice-srikrishna-committee-report/"">Read about it here</a>).<strong> <br /></strong></li></ul><p><strong>2. Redrafting the Indian Privacy Code</strong>: This has been a hell of a lot of work! SaveOurPrivacy's model code on privacy has undergone the process of a complete redraft. To ensure we do this well, we held a a roundtable with some of the best legal counsels and academics to ensure the code is equipped to address further issues of data protection, privacy and surveillance. We will be releasing this version publicly by the end of this week with an explainer. </p>
<p><strong>3. Fighting in the courts:</strong> In our fight against mass surveillance, we have challenged the surveillance practices of Government through a writ against the Ministry of Home Affairs (<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/the-ministry-of-home-affairs-delegates-snooping-decryption-hacking-powers-abrogates-responsibility-and-undermine-privacy/"">Read about it here</a>). Parts of our work also included assisting in devising litigation strategy and coordination with the People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL). More recently we sent a legal notice to the Delhi Government against the illegal CCTV project (<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/legal-notice-to-the-delhi-government-to-immediately-halt-cctv-installations/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">read more about it here</a>). <br /></p>
<p><strong>4. Filing RTIs. Ensuring transparency:</strong> In ensuring we cover all grounds, we filed a number of RTI's with the Central Government with queries on the Personal Data Protection Bill (<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/untitled-2/"">Read about it here</a>) and surveillance powers of the Ministry (<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/we-wont-give-up-iff-approaches-cic-against-mhas-refusal-to-disclose-surveillance-figures/"">Read about it here</a>). We have filed many, many more RTIs and will be announcing our larger advocacy plan on using transparency to ensure that the surveillance powers of government are exercised with proper safeguards and judicial and parliamentary oversight!<br /></p>
<p>This is definitely not the end of it. As we continue to carry these on, our plan towards protecting your digital rights in light of the impending passing of these proposals will fully rest on these themes. 
</p>
<ul><li><strong>Positively engage all government institutions with optimism and courage</strong>: IFF will continue to engage with the Government and parliamentarians in order to urge the transparency prevails through the disclosure of the full contours of the Data Protection Bill to its introduction in Parliament. At the same time we will continue to fight in courts, send notices and file RTIs.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Focus on interests of the individual as articulated by the fundamental rights of the Constitution of India</strong>: We will make every effort to ensure that any legal proposals or changes protect individuals like you! We will work tirelessly to ensure that each government programme, or private use impacting privacy is rights oriented by making sure dangerous proposals such as mandatory, indefinite data retention and breaking encryption as suggested by the Intermediaries Rules do not proceed.</li></ul><p><em>Yes, we can do more, and have more impact! But, we cannot do this alone. We welcome all offers of collaboration and support! </em><em><br /></em></p>

<ul><li><strong>Background: </strong>The Draft Data Protection Bill was released for public consultation on August 14, 2018. While there have been several submissions, they were not made public. The Bill was not passed in the 2018 winter session of Parliament that it was initially introduced but press reports confirm it will be listed in this session of parliament. </li><li><strong>Need for transparency:</strong> As this Bill moves toward becoming law, concerns grow with the not only visibility of its current state but also with its pre-existing content. IFF writes to Minister of Electronics and Information Technology, Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad emphasising the need for transparency. 
</li></ul><h3>Furthering the right kind of Privacy</h3>
<p>The public consultation that took place in August 2018 for the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill, did not result with the submissions made by various stakeholders being made public. Essentially this defeats the purpose in providing information that would enable us to make better responses to any suggestions that would result in the dilution of privacy protections in India. 
</p>
<p>IFF filed two RTI’s with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology on October 16, 2018 to understand the purpose in maintaining such secrecy. We asked for information of those who made submissions to the public consultation and the content of the submissions and if anyone else that may have aided the process of drafting the law or reviewing the submissions. However, we only received the number of submissions to the bill which was a total of 624, without their actual text being made public while the second query was blatantly rejected on the unavailability of information with the concerned Central Public Information Officer. 
</p>
<p>While awaiting responses to Second Appeals filed with the Central Information Commission, it seemed necessary to write to Hon'ble Shri. Ravi Shankar voicing our concerns (<a href=""https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3J0iAyRzCGxbFI0dVBEMlRSMEFfd244am9uaUs5blQ0eGhN"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Read about it here</a>). 
</p>
<p>Our representation reiterates the need for transparency in the public consultation procedure. The Draft Personal Data Protection Bill will most definitely revolutionise the current state of the industry; this requires that the industry and various other stakeholders be made aware of the current state of the Bill that is intended to be passed by Parliament. 
</p>
<p>IFF will continue to advocate for the privacy of the Indian citizens, the first step in this journey is to ensure compliance with the Pre-legislative Consultation Policy formulated by the Cabinet of Secretaries. We request that the procedure set by the policy involving at the very least a summary of the submissions provided. </p>
<p>As we hope our request is given due consideration, IFF continues ensure data protection and privacy moves to forefront as is needed in this day and age.

<ul><li><strong>Background: </strong>While the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill marinates with new and improved changes privy to no one, an issue of transparency that has consistently been raised, the growing risks to the data of Indian citizens only continues to increase in number. 
</li><li><strong>Immediate need for a Data Protection Framework<strong>:</strong></strong> We wrote a representation to the Hon'ble Minister for Electronics and Information Technology asking on the status of the much awaited Data Protection Bill. More importantly what it will look like and why it should be made public prior to it's introduction in parliament. 
</li><li><strong>Thank you parliamentarians:</strong> We also wrote to close to ten parliamentarians for not only opposing the Aadhaar Amendment Bill but asking for a rights focused data protection law. 
</li></ul><h3>Running out of time but never out of slime - new and improved ways to threaten your personal data</h3>
<p>With great power, comes great responsibility. The stream of new technologies continuous to remind us of the various ways we are currently left vulnerable only solidifying our need for a data protection law. 
</p>
<p>In light of this, we wrote to Minister of Electronics and Information Technology, Shri. Ravi Shankar Prasad on the immediate need for a data protection law (<a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x9DGhuz_f372rzIqFc-Jwmhx50ieIZHM/view?usp=sharing"">Read here for more</a>). 
</p>
<p>Right now India is under a privacy onslaught. This comes from several government policies and programs. Here are a few select ones: 
</p>
<p>1. <em>Facial Recognition</em>: On June 28, 2019, the NCRB released a call for tender, inviting bidders to provide Automated Facial Recognition Systems (AFRS) with the intention of creating a repository of “crime and criminal facial data”. The RFP for AFRS is alarming; it furthers critical privacy violations large-scale surveillance and also discriminatory profiling.</p>
<p>2. <em>CCTV</em>: Delhi has recently had the “privilege” of installing over 1.4 lakh CCTV all over the city with the intention of providing security to women. The project is itself illegal as it has no statutory basis to substantiate the violation of privacy under Puttaswamy v. Union of India. In addition, there is an absolute lack of transparency in the manner in which this project is advancing but questions of the protection of the storage, accessibility and security of such footage continues to remain answered.</p>
<p>3. <em>Social media linking</em>: To add to the dynamic nature of our current concerns, an order was released by the Indian Higher Education Secretary asking students to link their social media accounts to all higher education institutes (HEI) as well as the Ministry of Human Resource and Development (HRD) without regard for the privacy of students and its impact on their freedom of speech and expression.</p>
<p>4. <em>National Economic Survey</em>: While an entire chapter in the survey has been dedicated to purely data, the approach is extremely concerning. Following the narrative set by the Draft National Economic Policy, it treats data as a public good which is at the disposal of the Government to be used in a manner it deems fit. This understanding is fundamentally incorrect as it does not recognise that ownership should remain in the hands of an individual. </p>
<p>The Draft Personal Data Bill has still not made its way to Parliament. In addition, there is no transparency on the actual content of the Bill in its current form (<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/lest-we-consult-too-much/"">Read our post on this</a>). As we emphasised in the representation, India appears to be settling in quite well within the definition of a digital dystopia.<br /></p>
<p>It is with these chilling concerns that we reach out to the Ministry on the immediate need for the Data Protection framework, one that is fully rights respecting rather than a mere after-thought. The current Draft Personal Data Protection Bill should maintain its earlier standard and its framework needs to be disclosed in order to ensure that the approach to data as is in proposals such as the Draft National E-Commerce Policy and the National Economic Survey do not make individuals data a “public good” relinquishing the individual of control of their own data. We have requested that the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology proactively engage and ensure the essence of a data protection law as is in several other jurisdictions is maintained.
</p>
<p>We will continue to engage with all forms of Government in ensuring India receives a data protection legislation that puts it citizens first!

We've had the introduction of numerious CCTVs across the city of Delhi, facial recognition floated around for the purposes of crime databases, airport control and in combination with biometric systems and even the selling of vehicular data for commercial benefits. it only goes to show the degrees of vulnerability Indian citizens and their data currently face without a data protection law in force.</p>
<p>While we wait for the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018 to be finalised, as we informed you not too long ago, IFF announced that the a new and improved version of the Indian Privacy Code was tabled in Parliament by DMK MP Dr. Ravi Kumar as a private member's bill (<a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/blog/personal-data-and-information-privacy-code-bill-2019-introduced-in-the-lok-sabha-today-saveourprivacy"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Read here for more</a>). This bill continues to go beyond purely data protection and also includes surveillance reform setting it apart from the current Draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018 being deliberated by the Government.
</p>
<p>This private members bill has now been updated in its full form on saveourprivacy.in. As always we are thrilled to have any inputs from our community on how we can improve the bill to best protect the right to privacy and the protection of data of the Indian citizens.

<ul><li><em>Background:</em> The past few months have been full of attacks on privacy. These include the government selling vehicle registration data, introducing facial recognition technology and increasing CCTV surveillance. Unfortunately, all this is being done in the absence of any safeguards, principal amongst them is a data protection bill.
</li><li><em>IFF goes to Parliament:</em> Dr. Ravikumar (Lok Sabha, MP from Tamil Nadu), has introduced the Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019 today. This is a substantive redraft of the Indian Privacy Code which puts the interests of Indian citizens first.
</li></ul><h3>Parliament gets a modern, progressive legislative proposal</h3>
<p>August is coming! And that makes it a full year since the consultations on India’s data privacy regime were held. More than two years after the epoch defining right to privacy judgement a data protection regime seems distant. Meanwhile, surveillance grows in scope, sophistication and creep.
</p>
<p>Since the consultations in August, 2018 there has been little movement on the Personal Data Protection Bill. But there has been a lot of activity on projects which pose massive threats to privacy (<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/running-out-of-time-but-never-out-of-slime-new-ways-in-which-your-data-is-threatened/"">read more on it here</a>)! We do not know if, and when the Government will table a bill for it, and what final form it will take. This is characteristic of a process that has lacked transparency even during the proceedings of the Justice Srikrishna Expert Committee (<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/untitled-2/"">read more</a>).
</p>
<p>Today, Dr. Ravikumar, Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha, (read more on him <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-constituency-then-state-nation/story-6ZrWdYrzqWouzvAVUERwlJ.html"">here</a>) tabled the Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019. This is a private member’s bill based off a reworked, updated, Indian Privacy Code, 2018 and the 7 Privacy Principles. The public comments received on it have been factored and changes have been made. We thank for the wide ranging participation by individuals and organisations in supporting it.
</p>
<h3>Blueprint for a rights based data protection and surveillance reform law</h3>
<p>There is very low chance that the Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019 will pass into a law, but it is one more small act of faith to protect the privacy of everyday, ordinary Indians. It will hopefully provide a useful basis, for study, inspire debate by our parliamentarians who are actively engaging on issues of data protection and surveillance reform. At the time of filing, it is the only legislative proposal on this issue.
</p>
<p>Our engagement in this effort is a continuing attempt in a range of actions across institutions which have been documented at length at the SaveOurPrivacy.in campaign website. We have in the past worked with different members of parliament and will continue to do so to advance data protection and surveillance reform. We will also post analysis on this bill, and further upload it for further public debate and discussion.
</p>
<p>We thank not only Dr. Ravikumar but all parliamentarians, notably <em>Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Anand Sharma, Anupriya Patel, Asaduddin Owaisi, Bhubaneswara Kalita, Binoy Viswam, D. Ravikumar, Jairam Ramesh, K.K. Ragesh, Kinjarapu Ram Mohan Naidu, Mahua Moitra, Manish Tewari, Manoj Kumar Jha, M Selvaraj, N.K. Premachandran, P.K. Kunhalikutty, Prashanta Nanda, P.R.

Thirumavalavan, Veer Singh, Vijayasai Reddy and Sanjay Singh</em> who are actively engaging on the issue of data protection. (wasn’t that a long list of names? These are just the MPs who have spoken in this present session of parliament on the need for a data protection law, showing how the issues cuts across party lines).

12531,"#PrivacySupreme: Two years of the Right to Privacy.",privacysupreme,,,admin,2019-08-24,,Yes,live,"Joanne D'Cunha","<p>Today marks the second year anniversary of a momentous day in constitutional history in the digital day and age. On August 24, 2017, the Right to Privacy was identified as a fundamental right under the Constitution of India by a nine judge bench of the Supreme Court. The declaration of privacy as a right has had manifold impact not only affecting direct issues of data protection but even larger areas of mass surveillance and personal aspect such as the right to one's own sexuality.</p>
<p>The Right to Privacy is very close to our hearts, it has been one of IFF's core issues and we have consistently been working to ensure the same for citizens of India. Our fight for privacy has persisted since the introduction of the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018 with submissions to public consultations, RTIs requesting transparency and disclosure, advocating for privacy through intrusive government schemes such as CCTVs and facial recognition systems and most recently, the tabling of the Personal Data and Information Privacy Code, 2019 in the Lok Sabha aided by the wonderful Dr. Ravi Kumar (Lok Sabha, MP from Tamil Nadu). This is only the beginning. 
</p>
<p>We will work with all institutions of governance and also continue to challenge them to do better, to continue to work towards ensuring an individual's right to privacy is put first and foremost. 
</p>
<p>In light of this journey as country, IFF due to the partnership and support of Mozilla will celebrate today with an event that will feature talks and a conversation with Justice B.N. Srikrishna. This will be to the benefit to a cross section of stakeholders and we hope bring varied perspectives such as on gender and criminal justice that are an integral parcel of privacy right. Since seating and space has been limited we are video recording this event and will post it online soon. 
</p>
<p>We are also encouraging a wider community today to mark, celebrate on what privacy means to them by posting on social media. If you feel like it please do consider tagging it with #PrivacySupreme.

<ul><li><em>Background:</em> The UN Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy is exploring the importance of the right to privacy specifically its enjoyment based on gender and personality (read to include sexual orientation, gender identity/expression). It has put out a call for feedback on a report created on this issue and a consultation it intend to have at the end of October.
</li><li><em>IFF gets on board</em>: To contribute to the report and the consultation, IFF submits a few of its concerns and recommendations on privacy and gender and personality based on the work it does. 
</li></ul><h3>Background </h3>
<p>The report the Taskforce created analyses submissions and research on the varying impact of privacy on individuals with different orientations, genders, sexuality etc. This report was circulated to receive feedback from various stakeholders across the public and private sectors of Member States, human rights institutions, NGOs, individuals, civil society and researchers in order to conduct an international public consultation. 
</p>
<p>The consultation looks to check if gender based issues that arise in the digital era have a distinct impact on the existing right to privacy as we as individuals understand it. India is growing in its exposure and awareness to gender/personality matters and we hope that there has been sufficient representation of these issues such as the newly introduced Transgender bill etc., in this consultation by various organisations deeply involved and with greater expertise. IFF is privileged to have had the opportunity to share our comments and recommendations on the reportin addressing increasingly significant concerns based on our learnings in our line of work. 
</p>
<h3>Our Concerns</h3>
<p>We cover aspects of the report that complement IFF’s core areas of work in this field of digital rights and would prove useful in understanding the Indian landscape with regard to privacy. Here are brief pointers of a few concerns we highlighted. 
</p>
<ul><li><em>Imbalance in accountability:</em> The need for smaller platforms to be more 'woke' in their approach toward addressing content that is abusive/discriminatory based on gender, caste, orientations considering the sectional diversity of India. 
</li><li><em>In the guise of women's safety: </em>Although done with the claim to increase the security of women, we highlight how large scale deployment of CCTVs combined with Automated Facial Recognition Systems is dangerous with no data protection law in place; especially pointing out the amplification of existing bias that such surveillance systems bring about. 
</li><li><em>Unknown and unchecked software: </em>In light of the Chinmayanand scandal (<a href=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/chinmayanand-case-body-cam-sleaze-counter-sting-but-slow-police-action/articleshow/71321780.cms"">Read about it here</a>), the use of an application to secretly film an individual has seen the light of day. We express concern about the use of such unknown applications used to target unsuspecting individuals that do not conform to India conservative societal norms. 
</li><li><em>Community data: </em>As the current atmosphere begs the need to demonstrate worries with this concept, we inform that the understanding of community data includes data that is anonymised or e-commerce data. This indicates that this type of data is irrelevant data, which is an incredibly incorrect assumption. If anonymised data can be re-identified and put to use, our submission emphasizes that publicly available data can most definitely be damaging; and with sufficient access and manipulation can once again attack minorities of both class and otherwise with the current raging biases in India. 
</li></ul><h3>Our two-cents</h3>
<p>Although we provide recommendations for each of our concerns, our broader suggestions largely focused on engaging with local groups to gain perspective on the impact of privacy on individuals from different walks of life. This conversation is extremely necessary to inform work being done by the UN Special Rapporteur as most groups lack capacity to contribute to such formal processes. 
</p>
<p>We are appreciative of this initiative by the Office of UN Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy taskforce and we hope that our submission has contributed a better understanding of these issues.

<p>The recent expose on snooping conducted on the Whatsapp platform through the use of Pegasus in India has garnered a lot of attention from the public, press and thankfully even Parliamentary Standing Committees. Press reports indicate interest has been showed by the Standing Committee on Home Affairs in examining the matter. We wrote to them with a few suggestions on the issue to take into consideration at their meeting today. 
</p>
<h3>Some background</h3>
<p>Our representation made sure to provide the Committee with brief background information on the incident. We covered our bases by explaining the role of CitizenLab, the NSO Group and the discovery of the attacks in India. We previously put out a statement on the issue in case you need a bit of catching up to do (<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/statement-scary-disclosures-on-use-of-nso-spyware-in-india-signal-a-need-for-urgent-remedy/"">Read here for more)</a>. 
</p>
<h3>Our worries</h3>
<p>We provide sufficient emphasis on the lack of legality to this entire fiasco. Here are a few snippets of our explanation: 
</p>
<ul><li><em>No legality:</em> There is no provision under Indian law under any circumstance that provides legal basis for the installation of such spyware; the powers under the pre-existing surveillance provisions of the Telegraph Act, 1885 and the Information Technology Act, 2000 do not permit the installation of spyware or hacking of mobile devices or computer resources, which is in fact criminalised under the Information Technology Act, 2000.
</li><li><em> Unimaginable hit to privacy: </em>The constitutional standard established in K. S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India ((2017) 10 SCC 1) applicable to the violation of the right to privacy, finds this instance of snooping to go way beyond the requirements of proportionality and necessity, conditions heavily mandated.
</li><li><em>No remedy: A</em>s secrecy is an inherent trait of surveillance, the individual under surveillance has no manner of proving it thereby being unable to establish a breach which curtails remedy to an individual under Article 32 and 226 of the Constitution.
</li></ul><p>In light of these concerns, we offered a few suggestions for the Committee to consider in their discussions on the issue. 
</p>
<ul><li><em>Testimonials and expert opinions:</em> We ask that individuals affected by this large breach of privacy be invited to provide testimonials in order for the Committees to gather necessary information it requires for it to take any necessary measures.
</li><li><em>Need for disclosure:</em> There is need for engagement with the Government in order to obtain clarity on this deep violation of human rights. We ask that significant Government officials be invited to depose before the Committees in order to obtain transparency through official disclosure of these concerning series of events. 
</li><li><em>Call for a moratorium:</em> In line with the key recommendation made by the report of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression, we request the Committee to publicly state the need for an immediate moratorium on the use or purchase of human rights violating surveillance technology by the Government until rigorous safeguards are put in place.
</li></ul><p>We hope the Committee has taken our inputs into consideration and addressed the looming concerns this incident has raised with regard to surveillance practices in India.

It was then referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee of Science and Technology, Environment, Forests and Climate Change on October 18. The Committee invited comments on the Bill till November 18 and oh, did we have a lot of comments. 
</p>
<h3>What's it all about?</h3>
<p>India has been attempting to introduce legislation that regulates DNA technology since the early 2000's but thankfully has been largely unsuccessful until recently, making our fears quite real. The current DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill, 2019 has seen a number of redrafts bringing it to its present form and yet continues to be problematic. 
</p>
<p>We're grateful to be able to voice these concerns as the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology, Environment, Forests and Climate Change has invited comments on the Bill after it was referred to them. Unfortunately, as submissions made cannot be fully public prior to the Committee publishing their report, so we highlight our major concerns to give you an understanding of why we think the DNA Bill not only needs to undergo further work but also needs to be introduced only after a solid data protection law is in place. 
</p>
<h3>A few of our very many concerns</h3>
<ul><li><em>No data protection legislative framework</em>: With no overarching data protection legislation in India, the lack of obligation within the Bill to ensure protection especially by the DNA Laboratory as a either mere collectors or even processors of the DNA collected, have no alternative safeguards in place to remedy data breaches or ensure informed consent. Similarly, there is nothing to govern the sharing of such sensitive data, ensuring purpose limitation is maintained.
</li><li><em>Profiling and surveillance:</em> DNA profiles can reveal extremely sensitive information about an individual such as their skin colour, illness, susceptibility to diseases and any access to such intrusive information can be misused to specifically target individuals with their own genetic data and is particularly worrying as it could be used to incorrectly link a particular caste/community to criminal activities. Further, in the event that such a databases are then linked to others worrying databases in existence, it is bound to give rise to Government conducted mass surveillance. 
</li><li><em>Overbroad provisions: </em>Our submission tackles the lack of legitimate use by the Bill; it indicates that DNA technology intends to be used for extremely wide criminal and civil purposes (<strong>alarm bells are ringing</strong>). We argue that the Bill as such extensive databasing of DNA data requires to meet the conditions set by the Supreme Court's judgement in Puttaswamy of which one is a greater public purpose, the databasing of DNA used in civil cases does not fulfill this criteria. Further, even within criminal cases, there is need to limit the collection of DNA to the investigation and prosecution of cognizable crimes to ensure the data in the DNA database is minimal and controlled.
</li></ul><p>The submission details a plethora of other concerns ranging from lack of privacy safeguards such as no informed consent, storage and sharing of information and the power of the DNA profiling board. 
</p>
<p>We are grateful that the Committee has invited non-official witnesses/experts to provide their views on November 27 and hope that both written and oral submissions that come their way will be taken into strong consideration, resulting in the suggestion of a much required revising of the Bill.

<p>Much like our representation to the Standing Committee on Home Affairs, we sent across a few concerns on the Pegasus Spyware incident to the Standing Committee on IT that we thought needed addressing at their meeting on November 20, 2019. Our primary ask has been that the Committee invite those affected by the hacking to provide testimonials!
</p>
<h3>Some background</h3>
<p>If you haven't caught up with the ongoings of India's recent cyber-security incident, here's a statement we put out on the issue in case you need a bit of catching up to do (<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/statement-scary-disclosures-on-use-of-nso-spyware-in-india-signal-a-need-for-urgent-remedy/"">Read here for more)</a>. In brief, relying on spyware supplied by an Israeli cyber-intelligence firm, which was installed through a missed call on Whatsapp after which an attacker would gain complete access to a smartphone, individuals in India were found to have been targetted. 
</p>
<h3>Specific asks of the Committee</h3>
<p>Our representation covered the lack of legality, the violation of privacy and the unavailability to remedy, as we did with the Committee on Home Affairs. However, the most significant of the asks we made of the Committee lies in the request that the victims of the hacking be given the stage to provide testimonials before the Committees. A number of these individuals have even put out a statement asking the Government to reveal information on the issue (R<a href=""https://countercurrents.org/2019/11/open-letter-to-the-government-of-india-from-pegasus-targeted-persons"">ead here for more</a>) and have even expressed willingness to depose before the Committee (<a href=""https://countercurrents.org/2019/11/pegasus-targeted-persons-demand-probe-from-the-parliamentary-standing-committee-on-information-technology"">Read here for more</a>). It is important that these first hand human experiences be provided to fully demonstrate the patently criminal surveillance they have been subjected to. 
</p>
<p>In light of all of this, here's an interesting titbit, Isreali law requires that an export permit is granted for the sale of this software (<a href=""https://www.novalpina.pe/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Legal-Opinion.pdf"">there's a whole licensing process</a>), therefore, the software supplied by the NSO Group is regulated under this. So, we thought it was important for the Committee to consider inviting the Israeli government to appear before the them to shed some light. Further, <a href=""https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/whatsapp-snooping-pegasus-documents-show-indian-government-likely-culprit_in_5dbbbd74e4b057bf506fa196"">in Facebook's civil complaint</a> in the California Court, an annexure of a contract between the NSO Group and Ghana indicates that the 'System Provider' which is the NSO Group shall receive a certificate which would also contain the identity of the 'end user'. This would be particularly interesting information to happen upon in order to establish identity in the attacks in India. 
</p>
<p>Looking at the bigger picture, we did touch upon broader concerns of India cyber-security with these suggestions for consideration. 
</p>
<ul><li><strong>Need for updation: </strong>India’s National Cybersecurity Policy has not seen any amendments since 2013 and while the new National Cybersecurity Coordinator has indicated that his office is seeking to ensure India has a new Cybersecurity Strategy in 2020, Parliament must act to ensure that this is openly consulted on, drawing on inputs from security researchers and other Indians who can provide their expertise to ensure a stronger National Cybersecurity Strategy that has widespread public support and awareness.
</li><li><strong>Lack of guidance: </strong>The time for a permanent advisory body is now more than ever. There is need for continuous counsel on matters of advancing technology and we have encouraged the Committee to ask the Government on how it can form a standing Digital Security Advisory body with stakeholders beyond civil servants, particularly as existing statutory bodies such as the Cyber Regulation Advisory Committee - mandated by the Information Technology Act - appear to be dormant.
</li></ul><p>While the heat of these events begins to fade, we hope that the Committee considers our suggestions to ensure it is made fully aware of the incident and its hit to India's cybersecurity.

<ul><li><strong>Background: </strong>On June 28, 2019, the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) invited bids from reputed turnkey solution providers for the implementation of a centralised Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS).
</li><li><strong><strong>N</strong>eed for established safeguards<strong>:</strong></strong> The proposal to introduce facial recognition into society currently comes with a variety of concerns that need to be addressed first. We write a legal notice to the NCRB with also a covering letter and a copy of the notice to Home Minister, Shri. Amit Shah and Home Secretary, Shri. Rajiv Gauba, highlighting the features and scope of the AFRS and its unfathomable detriment it could bring about to Indians if implemented.
</li></ul><h3><strong>Know your enemy</strong></h3>
<p>Its important to understand the characteristics the Request for Proposals requires the systems to possess, in order to understand how problematic it will be. Our legal notice highlights features which will be covered here in brief to provide basic context. 
</p>
<ol><li><em>Function: </em>The AFRS is intended to be a repository of all crime and criminal related facial data and should be able to identify or verify a person from a variety of inputs ranging from images to videos. 
</li><li><em>Integration:</em> The system should be able to be integrated with various other databases such as ICJS, CCTNS, IVFRT, state police integration software in existence or any others. The integration does not stop there, it requires the system to be compatible with other biometric solutions such as Iris and AFIS but doesn't specify what these databases are. Might we have yet another Aadhaar worry to add to our frown lines?
</li><li><em>Identification:</em> As per requirements of the RFP, the system should not only be able to match images from a variety of databases, it should also be equipped to capture images from CCTV footage, public or private video feeds. As concerning as this sounds, there's more. It should also have the ability to tag images uploaded from newspapers, raids, sketches etc. with identifiers based on sex, age, scars, tattoos, consider landmarks, features and contours in identifying individuals and also accommodate for images with plastic surgery and make up for accuracy in identification. 
</li><li><em>Technical requirements: </em>The aspects that stuck out in the RFP largely related to the need for the system to be compatible with bio-metric solutions such as Iris and Fingerprint identification systems. It also requires there that there be security in storage, user access and authentication 
</li><li><em>Security requirements: </em>The bidder is largely responsible for additional measures in maintaining the integrity, confidentiality and availability of data that will be stored, apart from the established ISO standard prescribed in the RFP.
</li></ol><h3>Here's why we aren't quite ready for sci-fi</h3>
<p>We take a closer look at these <em>not so frightening</em> features and identify concerns with the entire technology itself. 
</p>
<ul><li><em>Absence of legality: </em>The requirement of facial recognition systems does not stem from a statutory basis nor is it a result of the executive power of the Government. Clearly it lacks any sort of legal backing. This is in addition to the violation of privacy it will so flagrantly undermine as it fails to fulfil any of the elements laid down by Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2017 (10) SCALE 1) in permitting a violation of privacy.
</li><li><em>Manifest arbitrariness:</em> Beginning to picture the massive invasion of privacy the AFRS will potentially have? Especially with its all seeing eye looking at not only databases and databases of images but also strategically located CCTV footage, images of newspaper clippings, raids, sketches etc., all most likely without your knowledge. This kind of en-masse surveillance is bound to bring about a high degree of damage. Studies by MIT and Georgetown and trials conducted the London Metropolitan Police acknowledge that pervasive biases that exist currently within our societies are likely to be mimicked by the algorithms within these systems. Mis-identification and discriminatory profiling is the result we're looking at if these systems are implements. Apparently, the already existing discriminatory practices perpetuated by human beings is no longer enough, we must look to AI to continue our dirty work. 
</li><li><em>Absence of safeguards and accountability:</em> In light of the above, there is currently no legal restrictions or limitations to this technology to ensure its proportional use or afford protection to those it interacts with. Add facial recognition to the on going debate on CCTVs and we have ourselves a full fledged mix of India and China no longer being restricted to the Indo-Chinese cuisine. 
</li></ul><p>Considering the trajectory India appears to be on with mass surveillance and technological perpetuating of discrimination, a scarier version of the Orwellian dystopia seems to be right up our alley. We urge the NCRB to take a step back and recall the bidding process for the Automated Facial Recognition System until adequate safeguards that address these various concerns are put into place. This request is also with a disclaimer that failure to do so may cause us to seek remedy in accordance with the law.

The spyware, “Pegasus” would be installed through a missed call on Whatsapp after which an attacker would gain complete access to a smartphone. As per the NSO Group, “Pegasus” was only sold to government clients. Subsequent reports by <a href=""https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/whatsapp-hacking-bhima-koregaon-lawyers-targeted_in_5dba8e9ae4b066da552c5028"">Huffington Post</a> and <a href=""https://www.newslaundry.com/2019/10/31/breaking-bela-bhatia-anand-teltumbde-among-indians-snooped-on-using-israeli-spyware"">News Laundry</a> have revealed that the targets include lawyers in the Bhima Koregaon case, Bela Bhatia and Anand Teltumbde. This raises some extremely disturbing questions about likely illegal hacking by unknown government agencies- or other actors operating in India- and suggests flagrant disregard for the rule of law and contempt for our fundamental right to privacy.
</p>
<p>There is an urgent need for official disclosure on whether and how this spyware was used in India to hack our citizens. The Government of India must issue an official public statement providing complete information. The Government must also clarify which law empowers it to install such spyware. To the best of our understanding and knowledge, no such power exists under Indian law, and the pre-existing surveillance powers available under the Telegraph Act, 1885 and the Information Technology Act, 2000 do not permit the installation of spyware or hacking mobile devices. Hacking of computer resources, including mobile phones and apps, is in fact a criminal offence under the Information Technology Act, 2000.
</p>
<p>This expose signals a need for urgent surveillance reform to protect citizens against the use of malware, spyware and creation of vulnerabilities in technologies which offer privacy protection by design. We call on the Government to stand by democratic commitments and reject the use of spyware in their pursuit of social objectives of policing and security. Legislative measures must be introduced in Parliament to uphold the 9 judge bench decision of the Supreme Court of India recognizing privacy as a fundamental right. The use of legal or technical means to access data and intercept communications in India must be authorised only in emergency situations, under judicial control and oversight, and with other protections to safeguard our citizens.
</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, we at IFF will attempt to reach out to any victims of illegal surveillance in India and we will make every attempt to ensure that they can access the legal system to seek redress. We will also examine avenues for further engagement with all branches of government - legislative, executive and judicial- to advance our ongoing work on surveillance reform. 
</p>
<p>In addition to seeking transparency through full disclosure, we hope to work towards solutions to ensure that something like this never happens again. We will continue our public advocacy through the SaveOurPrivacy Campaign which seeks to put forth a model draft law that provides for judicial oversight and parliamentary controls in the surveillance process. In July, a revised version of this model draft law was introduced in Parliament as a private member’s bill by Dr. Ravikumar as the Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019 which if enacted may help prevent such a recurrence.

<p>We sent a legal notice to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) on August 18, 2019 to halt and recall the invitation for bids for the implementation of a centralised Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS) put out on June 28, 2019 with extremely worrying features of the system. With no response, we sent a follow up on October 31, 2019, to which we received a very detailed reply by the NCRB on November 5, 2019. Excitedly, we readied ourselves to send across a rejoinder to their response but much to our dismay, we largely had to restate our original asks.
</p>
<h3>Position unchanged</h3>
<p>The follow up to our legal notice was graced by peculiar circumstances. The NCRB responded on November 5, 2019 with a detailed parawise reply to our notice dated August 18, 2019. However, not long after, we received emails from NCRB officials stating that they wished to recall the email response sent to us. Naturally, we wrote back enquiring if an updated or finalised version of the document needed to be sent, to which there has been no clarification.
</p>
<p>Given the tender closes today, we promptly sent across our rejoinder two days back, in the same format of their response. It involved us indulging in a lot of rebutting and here's what we had to say briefly. 
</p>
<ol><li><strong>Main submission dealt with legality</strong>Our legal notice informed the NCRB that there was no legislative framework that gave AFRS any legality and we reiterated that once again. Why? Because the NCRB informed us that AFRS will be hosted on the CCTNS database which finds its supposed legality in the CCTNS Cabinet Note of 2009. We made sure to explain that a cabinet note is not a statutory enactment but a record of proceedings, and hence, AFRS continues to lack legality. We very clearly observed that the use of such systems on dead bodies appears slightly redundant on account of bodies beginning to decompose within 24 hours after death, which does not justify public expenditure on this.
</li><li><strong>Flawed understanding of consent </strong>The response was firm in stating that the principle of consent would not be violated but did not have much to substantiate this point. It also says that Aadhaar would not be integrated with AFRS. We sure had a lot to say to this; our rejoinder pointed out the inadvertent access that the integration of various databases will provide. Further, the Aadhaar database, through the already existing access State police have, quite clearly violates consent considering that an individual may have only given consent to one database and its use.
</li><li><strong>Systems are apparently too cutting edge </strong>Our concerns of misidentification and discriminatory profiling were met with blanket responses that AFRS would simply not face these problems as it would meet NIST standards (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and also have sufficient safeguards in its Standard Operating Procedure. Our response makes sure to highlight how without any legal framework, there would be nothing to provide for strict safeguards and also cases from San Francisco and Massachusetts that have found that their cutting edge technology too faces concerns of misidentification and discriminatory profiling.
</li><li><strong>No need for proportionality/safeguards but oversight and accountability will still exist</strong>The response by the NCRB claims that there would be no need for proportionality or any safeguards and they substantiate this with requirements provided for device security and unauthorised access. We point out their misunderstanding of proportionality and safeguards by explaining our worries of mass surveillance that could ensue because of such unregulated technology. 
</li></ol><h3>Stop! In the name of law</h3>
<p>It is important to note that a lot of what the NCRB has stated, marks a large departure from what the Request for Proposal (the tender document) states. Although we appreciate the NCRB's efforts in responding to our legal notice, at the end of this, we had to restate most of our initial submissions. While we do not want to take any credit for this outcome, the date for the tender has once again been extended to January 3, 2020. 
</p>
<p>As a result, our rejoinder continues to ask for a withdrawl of this tender and a moratorium on all privacy invading projects until a data protection law and authority is in existence. We intend to examine all legal options to challenge it after conferring with counsel if it proceeds further.

To take down your posts “pro-actively” and by requiring traceability. Why is it being done secretly? Why are you not being involved?? We first explain what these rules do, then pose the top 5 concerns for users in a rule by rule analysis. 
</p>
<p><strong>Due to substantial public interest being at stake, we also are making available <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ong2rw-WeYzS-9eMNCP0R3yn9srfiXBb/view?usp=sharing"">a complete copy of these draft rules here</a>. </strong>
</p>
<h2>What are the intermediary rules?</h2>
<p>These are rules called the <a href=""http://meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/GSR314E_10511%281%29_0.pdf"">Intermediary Rules, 2011</a> and are made under the Information Technology Act, 2000 that provide immunity for online platforms, ISPs - big, large, and tiny - for the content which is transmitted and published by end users. This allows these conduits of information to facilitate a core function of free expression and prevents them from throttling content or overbroad censorship which is termed as a, “chilling effect”. In return, they have to comply with legal requests for takedown of content and provide information on users - basically comply with the law. This was a principle recognised in Section 79 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (as amended in 2008). 
</p>
<p>But principal legislations such as Section 79 leave the details to subordinate rules. This is exactly what the Intermediary Rules are, which were made after<a href=""https://iltb.net/comments-on-draft-intermediaries-guidelines-2011-1cdfd4d53bc2""> public consultation</a> around March, 2011. There was dispute on how this consultation was carried out, but still the draft rules were published online and comments were invited by the Ministry of Electronics and IT. However, these rules were unclear and vague. For instance, they did not clearly state what was, “actual knowledge”, and due to this in the <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/110813550/"">Shreya Singhal case</a> (yes, the Section 66A one), the Supreme Court said, that, “actual knowledge” came only when these platforms received a legal notice from the police or a court, not from private parties. So what is being changed? And what is at stake? 
</p>
<p><strong>5 Top Concerns</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>1. On process:</strong> First let us start with how these draft rules are being made. This is a serious development and is eerily reminiscent of the calls for pre-censorship made in December, 2011. As reported by the Express the process is closed, being held between officials of the Ministry of Electronics and IT and a handful of large social media and messaging companies who have been allowed to give comments by January 7. But the changes as we go on to explain will impact users like you and me. It will impact our right to privacy and freedom of speech and expression. Why is the public being kept out? 
</p>
<p><strong>2. Breaking encryption: </strong>Draft rule, 3(5) introduces the requirement of traceability which would break end to end encryption. 
</p>
<ul><li>Many platforms (Whatsapp, Signal, Telegram but even other platforms) retain minimal user data for electronic information exchange and also deploy end-to-end encryption to provide reliability, security and privacy to users. These are used by millions of Indians to prevent identity theft, code injection attacks. Encryption becomes more important as more of life now involves our personal data. Without thought or involving technical experts in an open consultative process, without any data protection law or surveillance reform, this is being tinkered with by introducing the requirement of, “traceability”. 
</li><li>This has important consequences for everyday users of online services and should also be seen in the context of the MHA notification which activates a 2009 rules which holds the power to direct, “decryption”. We do not have any proper parliamentary oversight or judicial check on surveillance and the latest draft rules, if they go through would be a tremendous expansion in the power of the government over ordinary citizens eerily reminiscent of China’s blocking and breaking of user encryption to surveil its citizens. 
</li></ul><p><strong>3. Longer even indefinite data retention: </strong>Draft Rule 3(8) increases the data retention period from 90 to 180 days and provides for further discretionary retention on the discretion of “government agencies”. The phrase, “government agencies” is not defined and the specific conditions or any outer limit for data retention at the end of the online platform is also not limited. Hence, by a mere letter by any government department, arguably a private platform can be required to store a users data indefinitely, without even letting this user know. It is important to remember that such retention will be even despite the user deleting the data on the servers of the intermediary. 
</p>
<p><strong>4. Pro-active censorship: </strong>Draft Rule 3(9) is the most dangerous bit which would be a sledgehammer to online free speech. Not abuse, harassment or threats, but legitimate speech by requiring online platforms to become pro-active arbiters and judges of legality (not their own terms of use which is a contract between the user and a platform). 
</p>
<ul><li>Placing such a requirement for a platform to obtain immunity from prosecution and actively sweep its platform would result in widespread takedowns without any legal process or natural justice. This violates the reasoning of the <em>Shreya Singhal judgement</em> which noted, “it would be very difficult for intermediaries like Google, Facebook etc. to act when millions of requests are made and the intermediary is then to judge as to which of such requests are legitimate and which are not.” It shifts the duty of the state to a private party.
</li><li>What is worse? It will be done by, “t<em>echnology based automated tools or appropriate mechanisms</em>”. Such tools have been shown to be <a href=""https://freedex.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/2015/files/2018/10/AI-and-FOE-GA.pdf"">faulty, have coding biases and prone to overbroad censorship</a>. Should we subject our fundamental right to free speech on the basis of a developing technology measure? AI censorship is the <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/9728b178-59b4-11e8-bdb7-f6677d2e1ce8"">Chinese model of censorship</a>. 
</li></ul><p><strong>5. The nanny requirement: </strong>Draft Rule 3(4), inserts a monthly requirement (at the least) to inform users about the legal requirements such as the terms and conditions and privacy policy. At first blush this may seem as a needed measure, with rampant online abuse and trolling. But consider the change in the environment from a public part to a guarded school yard in which you are constantly reminded that you are under watch and you better behave yourself. It will turn the internet in India into a corporal environment which is bad for users. Rather than letting market mechanisms figure out a notification for good conduct, which is in the best interests of platforms themselves, such a measure by law will require product side changes for smaller startups and entrepreneurs as well. 
</p>
<p>There are many more problems which will comment and analyse during the day and the coming week. 
</p>
<p>At IFF we believe there are better ways to check misinformation and threats to Indian elections. These can be achieved as per our fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution. The instant proposals seen alongside the recent MHA notification activating the 2009 interception rules is taking India close to a Chinese model of censorship. Yes, online platforms are problematic, they require fixes. But driving changes through a closed and secretive process in which measures that undermine fundamental rights is a harmful approach for all of us. 
</p>
<p>To us the path to disinformation is by first checking and bringing in a comprehensive privacy law which brings the power and control of smartphones in the hands of ordinary Indians. This will help bring accountability to large data controllers, from online companies which target us with advertising that is used by political parties. We also need to focus on steps and support the Election Commission. But right now, today, we all need to do is push back and speak up to <a href=""http://saveourprivacy.in/"">#SaveOurPrivacy</a> and #RightToMeme

12596,"Supreme Court issues notice on IFF's petition for surveillance reform #SaveOurPrivacy",supreme-court-issues-notice-on-iffs-petition-for-surveillance-reform-saveourprivacy-1,,,admin,2019-01-14,,Yes,live,"Apar Gupta","<h2><strong>Highlights</strong></h2>
<ul><li><strong>MHA Notification:</strong> On December 20, 2018, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued a notification authorizing 10 central agencies to intercept, monitor and decrypt any computer information causing a massive outrage on the expanding surveillance powers and the threats to informational privacy.
</li><li><strong>IFF's Petition:</strong> We - along with a batch of other petitioners - challenged the MHA Notification. IFF has also challenged the principal power of interception for computer systems under Section 69 of the Information Technology Act and the 2009 rules made under it.
</li><li><strong>A case of sweeping significance:</strong> Our petition is aimed at greater reform and oversight of surveillance in India. As the worlds largest digital democracy, with the second highest number of internet users, we seek greater safeguards and believe it was necessary for us to file the first substantive judicial challenge on surveillance powers in our new digital society.
</li><li><strong>Supreme Court issues notice:</strong> Today (January 14, 2019), the Supreme Court after hearing arguments by lawyers, including IFF's lead counsel, Mr. K.V. Vishwanathan, Senior Advocate was pleased to agree to hear the case. It seeks the government's response in 6 weeks.
</li></ul><h2>Preventing India from turning into a surveillance state</h2>
<p>A key pillar of our founding mandate is to ensure that informational privacy in the digital age is protected. To do this we often engage with the institutions of the state. For instance, on the legislative side, our #SaveOurPrivacy campaign includes a model law called the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 which includes surveillance reform. Given that privacy is a fundamental right, in addition to having a statute (a law enacted by parliament), we also need to check the power of the government to snoop and bring accountability to the process.
</p>
<p>Many people wonder and say, that surveillance will not happen to them (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4GIQW0Xfs8&amp;t=1s"">click here to see how easy it is</a>). But this is simply not true due to modern technologies which pervasively and persistently gather personal data of individuals. This is a problem which is further compounded by the wide powers of the Government which are concentrated in the executive branch of government to request, retain and collect this data. This power which was originally in place in the Indian Telegraph Act (which would ordinarily apply to telephone conversations) made its way to the Information Technology Act in Section 69. 
</p>
<p>Many commentators in the past have noted that this is a problem. The orders for interception do not have any meaningful checks and balances. The entire process is opaque and this by itself tremendously threatens privacy. Now imagine this pre-existing power applying to all your digital data. It becomes incredibly frightening. 
</p>
<p><strong>The need for judicial intervention</strong>
</p>
<p>When the Ministry of Home Affairs on December 20, 2018 issued a notification authorising 10 central agencies under Section 69 to conduct digital surveillance there was massive media outrage. Many termed it as an attack on our online privacy and with good reason. Some of this commentary can be found on our <a href=""https://twitter.com/internetfreedom/status/1075954903279943681"">twitter thread </a>and <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/the-ministry-of-home-affairs-delegates-snooping-decryption-hacking-powers-abrogates-responsibility-and-undermine-privacy/"">our previous post</a>. 
</p>
<p>Since these threads did not seem to be any closer to a remedy, it became clear to us that we would have to approach a court for remedy on behalf of the crores of Indians who are online and many more who are joining in every day. It was a question of their autonomy and ability to be free from the constant watch of a government, to enjoy liberty and their fundamental rights in a society that is increasingly digitized.
</p>
<p>In this case, we joined with other petitioners (who filed their own independent petitions) including, M.L. Sharma, Amit Sahni, Mahua Moitra and Shreya Singhal. At present we are not precisely aware of the scope of their challenges, but to a large measure are confident they share cause in a challenge to over-broad, unaccountable surveillance. Our petition challenges, Section 69 of the Information Technology Act; the Interception Rules, 2009; and the MHA Notification and we are providing a public copy as a public charitable organization working on an issue of public interest.
</p>
<p><strong>Proceedings in the Supreme Court</strong>
</p>
<p>Our legal team is lead by Senior Advocate K.V. Vishwanathan who was assisted by a superb team of lawyers including Karan Lahiri, Vrinda Bhandari, Gautam Bhatia and Sai Vinod. Our advocate on record is Prateek Chadha. Working together they were today (in addition to other petitioners and their distinguished senior counsel) able to persuade the Hon'ble Supreme Court in a bench presided by the learned Chief Justice of India, Shri Ranjan Gogoi to issue notice and require the government to file a response. This means this case will get heard by the Supreme Court and indicates hope towards the possibility of surveillance reform in India. 
</p>
<p>We will keep updating all of you on its progress. This is an incredibly important case for the future of digital privacy and we request everyone to pay close attention to it.

12597,"TOP SECRET: MHA Refuses to reveal total number of snooping requests",top-secret-mha-refuses-to-reveal-total-number-of-snooping-requests,,,admin,2019-02-06,,Yes,live,"Apar Gupta","<p>On 20th December 2018, the Cyber and Information Security Division of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued an order which authorises ten security and intelligence agencies to intercept, monitor and decrypt any information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer resource.<br /></p>
<p>We called to attention the risks this poses to our online privacy saying that it enables surveillance without any transparency or oversight. It lacks any meaningful safeguards. These arguments are at the center of the <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/supreme-court-issues-notice-on-iffs-petition-for-survelliance-reform-saveourprivacy/"">case filed by IFF </a>which is challenging the legality of the digital surveillance system before the Supreme Court of India.
</p>
<p>In order to get to the bottom of this order and do something about it, IFF filed six RTIs seeking answers to the following rather basic questions:
</p>
<ol><li>How many times has the government used its powers for interception?
</li><li>How many agencies have been authorized to intercept, monitor or decrypt data
</li><li>The names and the directions provided to the abovementioned agencies.
</li><li>Date, time and duration of meetings conducted by the Review Committee.
</li><li>How many times has the government received requests from different agencies seeking interception? (a) Number of requests denied. (b) Number of requests approved.
</li><li>How many times has an order been issued to prevent any offence which affects the sovereignty, integrity, defence or security of the state?Number of times order issued to investigate into an offence.
</li></ol><p>According to us, these are very reasonable queries which help us understand how surveillance practices are implemented in India. Their disclosure is primarily to infer broad operational trends and implement safeguards and they would in no way impact national security.
</p>
<p>Well, to our disappointment all six RTIs were rejected. The grounds cited are sections 8(1)(a), 8(1)(g) and 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act 2005 on the grounds that ‘Disclosure of information related to lawful interception/phone tapping/monitor or decrypt is exempted’. This basically means that the government is unwilling to tell us who has access to all our private data and why they have access to it. If anything this reply confirmed, it was the complete secrecy and lack of oversight in digital surveillance by the Government of our personal data.
</p>
<p>Next steps? We will be filing an appeal against this denial and pursuing these RTIs to their logical conclusion. 
</p>
<p>We would also like to indicate that RTI Activist, Mr. Venkatesh Nayak (Coordinator, Access to Information, Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative) has filed similar RTIs and received a similar rejection. He has recently penned a legal analysis on it <a href=""https://theleaflet.in/computers-intercepted-transparency-interrupted-mhas-cpio-refuses-information-about-december-2018-authorisation-order-under-the-it-act"">at the Leaflet</a>.

<ul><li><strong>Background:</strong> In December, a private meeting was held by Ministry Officials with social media companies and industry associations. In this disturbing changes to the the Intermediary Rules were suggested. They would hurt our online privacy and be a massive blow to free speech online. 
</li><li><strong>Roll back this consultation:</strong> We made it a point to explain to you the damaging effect it would have on your online freedom but we are not alone. Many other digital rights organisations have articulated a principled and powerful opposition to these proposed changes. 
</li><li><strong>You can help:</strong> Send an email right now. We tell you how at the end of this post.
</li></ul><p><strong>Why are any changes to the Intermediary Rules important?</strong>
</p>
<p>Intermediary rules impact all of us. Think about the legal rules that govern your ISP (think : Airtel, Idea-Vodafone, Jio or others), or a large social media platforms (Wikipedia, Github, Facebook, Sharechat, Youtube, Instagram, Twitter etc.), even small start-up online services you use and enjoy (for me it is personally IndianKanoon). Any changes to these rules not only massively change your online experience but also threaten your online privacy and free speech. In this context, the proposed changes to them gain importance. 
</p>
<p><strong>What changes have been proposed ?</strong>
</p>
<p>In changes proposed late last year (<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/india-must-resist-the-lure-of-the-chinese-model-of-surveillance-and-censorship-intermediaryrules-righttomeme-saveourprivacy/"">read more here for context</a>) the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MEITY) proposed changes to the Intermediary Rules, 2011. This was initially done privately and after an Indian Express report, and us publicly disclosing them in full, MEITY acknowledged them and opened a public consultation. But there are problems with these proposed changes much beyond the initial secrecy. And it's just not us saying this. Many other groups are taking leadership on this issue. 
</p>
<p>There seems to be somewhat of an unanimous response of several civil society organisations and research groups for the government to reconsider these proposed changes. Even though many have articulated different reasoning, emphasised a range of problems – constitutional, policy oriented, economic and technical. They all seem to be in broad agreement that these rules are bad for users, internet companies and the internet. They would hurt your privacy and online free speech without making you safer in any meaningful way. Even we in our submissions to an ongoing public consultation have made a clear call to MEITY to reboot this entire exercise (<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/we-urge-meity-to-press-reboot-on-the-intermediary-rules-saveourprivacy-righttomeme/"">read here for more</a>).
</p>
<p>But, don't take only our work for it. We have tabulated a table (<a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1peFYrzfHwa5QoFMUFFtesdmMTdqEuDLi/view?usp=sharing"">PDF</a> or <a href=""https://drive.google.com/open?id=1peFYrzfHwa5QoFMUFFtesdmMTdqEuDLi"">Google Docs</a>) with the voice of digital rights and research organisations who in 16 separate submissions make a common point. The proposed changes to Intermediary Rules must be reconsidered, if not recalled.
</p>
<p><strong>What can you do to help ?</strong>
</p>
<p>Simple, send an email to MEITY. This will not take more than a few minutes.
</p>
<ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a covering email with the subject, ""Proposed Changes to IT Rules"", which reads for instance as:
</li></ul><blockquote>“I support the attached spreadsheet which quotes digital rights and research groups in their submissions against the unconstitutional provisions of The Information Technology Rules 2018 that will affect my Right to Privacy and Freedom of Speech online. I call on you to recall the proposed changes to the Intermediary Rules, 2011”</blockquote>
<ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Attach the sheet of comments (<a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1peFYrzfHwa5QoFMUFFtesdmMTdqEuDLi/view?usp=sharing"">PDF</a> or <a href=""https://drive.google.com/open?id=1peFYrzfHwa5QoFMUFFtesdmMTdqEuDLi"">Google Docs</a>) by digital rights and research organisations.

<ul><li><strong>Background:</strong> In 2014, Avnish Bajaj, the founder of Baazee.com was arrested. What was his crime? Bajaj had joined investigations and was helping police with an investigation in the online sales of a clip that contained a sexually explicit material that came to be known as the, “DPS MMS clip”. This lead to better protections for online businesses in law what were called a safe harbor protections under the Information Technology Act.
</li><li><strong>Recall proposal for changes:</strong> We analysed and prepared a guide for you on how a series of proposed changes to the safe harbor protections may have an adverse effect on your abilities and functioning as a start-up. Most of these changes would be bad for your users and your businesses. They would erode your users privacy and free speech and also saddle you with costs and compliances.
</li><li><strong>Take action now:</strong> You can prevent these proposals from advancing further. This can be done in very simple ways by sending an email and engaging with an ongoing public consultation process. 
</li></ul><h3><strong>How do the changes affect you?</strong></h3>
<p>The changes to the Intermediary Rules will have a drastic impact on each stakeholder of the internet, especially all you aspiring entrepreneurs. The Rules tighten the reins with increased regulatory compliances and start-ups and small enterprises will find it extremely cumbersome to carry out business and meet the requirements set by law. This will impact your trust and reliability expected by users as their privacy and free speech rights will be put to risk. 
</p>

</p>
<h3>What are the changes?</h3>
<p>The Information Technology Act Section 79 protects intermediaries from liability for any content hosted or created by third parties as long as it has remained a mere facilitator of information and is not involved in the creation or modification of the same. However, this is about to change for the worse. Right now troubling amendments to the Intermediary Rules that are made under Section 79 have been mooted by the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY). 
</p>
<p>With a large portion of activities carried out on any online platform, certain aspects are bound to be beyond your control. Objectionable user comments or content should not put you in the ‘dog house’ with the authorities. The Information Technology Act up until now protected intermediaries, be it social networks or even e-commerce platforms. With the changes, intermediaries would be required to actively participate in the regulating of these issues. This is in addition to other onerous requirements the proposed law will ask of you.
</p>
<p>As a start-up, dedicating limited resources to this kind of active monitoring will definitely take a toll on your performance. We have explained how these Rules will affect you in detail. We want to ensure these rules are recalled.

In our counter-comments, we put together the tremendous support shown from Civil Society Organisations highlighting the unconstitutionality of these proposed changes (<a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rxJoEHM1m6IXprXENQyJwxU1cMSZuu6d/view?usp=sharing"">click here to read our counter comments</a>). We stand with these Organisations in the fight for your freedoms as we submit our counter comments to MEITY.
</p>
<p>However, there are always two sides to a coin. A few Industry Groups and companies are in complete support of these Rules. For instance, Reliance Jio states that, <em>“We strongly recommend that the intermediary should enable tracing out of originator of such information on its platform, which will help Government agencies identify the originator of such misleading information and hold them accountable in order to maintain cybersecurity.” </em>Sounds a little like a neighbouring country! 
</p>
<p><b>Defending</b><strong> our constitutional promises</strong>
</p>
<p>Apar Gupta, Executive Director at the Indian Freedom Foundation in an <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/technology/india-internet-censorship.html"">interview</a> with The New York Times warned,<em> ""This is very similar to what China does to its citizens, where it polices their every move and tracks their every post on social media"".</em>
</p>
<p>Throughout this process, we have tried to ensure these Rules are recalled. The Rules allow for ‘tracking’ through the weakening of end-to-end encryption, it necessitates providing the Government with information at the drop of a hat and also the removal of content on the internet based on still developing automated tools. These changes mean the information you send over applications could be traced by the Government. An intermediary could be required to provide any information about you. Anything you post on the Internet that is considered ‘unlawful’ could be taken down. These are just a few examples. 
</p>
<p>Fundamental Rights are a constitutional promise to every Indian. But these rules are an affront to our civil liberties.

12601,"IFF files rejoinder in PIL seeking surveillance reform",iff-files-rejoinder-in-pil-seeking-surveillance-reform,,,admin,2019-04-23,,Yes,live,"Devdutta Mukhopadhyay","<p><strong>Highlights</strong><br /></p>
<ul><li>Background: In January, IFF had filed a PIL challenging the constitutional validity of the existing electronic surveillance framework in India and we filed our rejoinder in the matter yesterday.</li></ul><ul><li>Need for judicial oversight: In the rejoinder, we have pointed out that the Government has failed to substantively engage with our contention that the standard for evaluating fundamental rights claims has changed after the landmark 9 judge bench decision in *KS Puttaswamy v. Union of India*. Under the newly adopted proportionality standard, electronic surveillance will pass constitutional muster only if there is judicial oversight, and the existing regime which concentrates all power in the hands of the executive requires urgent reform. </li></ul><h3>Background</h3>
<p>Remember IFF’s petition before the Supreme Court seeking surveillance reform? Well, there have been some interesting developments in the case recently. 
</p>
<p>Yesterday, IFF filed its rejoinder in the constitutional challenge against Section 69 of the IT Act and the IT (Procedure for Safeguards for Interception, Monitoring and Decryption of Information) Rules, 2009. At yesterday’s hearing, the Supreme Court took our rejoinder on record and directed the matter to be listed after two weeks. On 20 December 2018, the Ministry of Home Affairs had issued a notification authorizing ten law enforcement agencies to conduct electronic surveillance, and this prompted us to file a writ petition since it suggested an activation and expansion of the government’s surveillance machinery. You can read our detailed analysis of the history of surveillance in India <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/the-ministry-of-home-affairs-delegates-snooping-decryption-hacking-powers-abrogates-responsibility-and-undermine-privacy/"">here</a>.
</p>
<h3>The Government’s stance</h3>
<p>Various petitioners including IFF have questioned the constitutionality of the existing surveillance framework, and the Government filed a common counter-affidavit responding to all the petitions. As a result, the Government’s response consisted of broad assertions which failed to engage with the specific and nuanced arguments made in our petition. 
</p>
<p>First, the Government heavily relied on a never disclosed before Standard Operating Procedure to show that powers under Section 69 of the IT Act are exercised in a well regulated manner. Second, it repeatedly emphasized on the existence of a Review Committee in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in 1997 in <em>PUCL v. Union of India</em> as a sufficient safeguard. Finally, it stated that judicial oversight in the surveillance process was undesirable because in order to effectively tackle threats like terrorism and organized crime, the executive needs speedy decision making. It also produced before the Court an illustrative list of cases cracked using electronic surveillance. 
</p>
<h3>Why the Government’s defence is inadequate and misconceived </h3>
<p>The Government’s defence is like a bucket with too many holes that doesn’t hold water. In our rejoinder, we have responded to every argument made by the Government but four important submissions from our rejoinder are worth highlighting. 
</p>
<p><em>(1) The Standard Operating Procedure is secret and illegal</em> We have argued that the Standard Operating Procedure has no bearing upon 		the constitutionality of Section 69 of the IT Act or 2009 IT Rules. It is a form of 		executive action which lacks any legislative backing because it has not been 		issued under the IT Act or the Telegraph Act. Therefore, all electronic surveillance conducted pursuant to the Standard Operating Procedure before specific law enforcement agencies were notified on 20.12.2018 is illegal. 
</p>
<p>(2) <em>The Review Committee lacks judicial members and it is overburdened</em> The existence of a Review Committee is insufficient because it only consists of officials belonging to the executive branch. Since it does not have any independent judicial members, the Review Committee is unlikely to rigorously examine whether an interception order genuinely pursues a legitimate aim and whether less restrictive alternatives are available. Moreover, according to the Srikrishna Committee Report, the three member Review Committee has to evaluate 15,000-18,000 interception orders at every meeting. The sheer volume of interception orders makes it practically impossible for the Review Committee to apply its mind to each interception order or conduct any enquiry or investigation to determine if an interception order is lawful. Therefore, the Review Committee is effectively a rubber stamp for law enforcement agencies. 
</p>
<p>(3) R<em>eliance on PUCL v. Union of India is outdated and incorrect</em> The Review Committee is in conformity with the guidelines laid down in <em>PUCL v. Union of India</em> but that judgement was delivered twenty two years ago in the context of telephone tapping, and the technological landscape has undergone massive change since then. In the modern digital age, individuals share and store a large amount of sensitive personal data on their computers and smartphones. Further, law enforcement agencies are now equipped with advanced tools that have centralized and automated the surveillance process and even enabled them to track and analyse social media activity of citizens. Therefore, due to increase in both the government’s capability and the citizens’ vulnerability, the threat to privacy posed by electronic surveillance is substantially higher today than it was two decades ago. After the 9 judge bench decision of the Supreme Court in <em>KS Puttaswamy v. Union of India</em> recognizing a fundamental right to privacy, the judicial standard for adjudicating rights claims is the proportionality test, and in the absence of judicial oversight, surveillance cannot be considered proportionate.
</p>
<p><em>(4) Lack of transparency and withholding of surveillance related data</em> While submitting a list of illustrative cases cracked using surveillance, the Government has conveniently not revealed how many total interception orders were passed during the relevant period in spite of <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/top-secret-government-refuses-to-reveal-total-number-of-snooping-requests/"">multiple RTI requests</a>. Therefore, it is impossible for us to determine what proportion of electronic surveillance results in actionable intelligence and whether law enforcement agencies are casting an excessively wide net.

12602,"Legal notice to the Delhi Government to immediately halt CCTV installations.",legal-notice-to-the-delhi-government-to-immediately-halt-cctv-installations,,,admin,2019-06-06,,Yes,live,"Devdutta Mukhopadhyay","<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul><li><strong>Background: </strong>The Delhi Government is beginning installations of about 1.4 lakh CCTV cameras putting the privacy and freedom of millions of Delhi residents at risk. Feeds from these will be made available to RWAs and Market Associations - without any safeguards! 
</li><li><strong>Infringing privacy, threatening women's safety:</strong> The CCTV Project is completely illegal. It has no underlying legal framework or any legal safeguards. Even the bidding has been carried out in a secretive manner and our RTI for more information on it was deftly dodged by the Government. 
</li><li><strong>We put the Delhi Government to notice:</strong> Today we sent a legal notice after repeatedly bringing public attention to this issue through social media. In the instance the project continues, we will examine and undertake all steps available under law to fight and defend every person's privacy!
</li></ul><p>The Delhi Government was for years, stuck in a battle with the Lieutenant Governor to install and fulfil its promise of about 1.4 lakh CCTV cameras in Delhi at the cost of 500 crore. The LG’s office had recommended the cameras be installed with the permission of the police, and drafted <a href=""http://dceast.delhigovt.nic.in/wps/wcm/connect/b4db69004622dcdbb778b7c8da9eb17e/CCTV.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;lmod=1855201116&amp;CACHEID=b4db69004622dcdbb778b7c8da9eb17e"">rules</a> governing the use of CCTVs in Delhi. 
</p>
<p>Disregarding this, on June 3, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced installation of the cameras would finally begin by June 8. This is a project which will infringe the fundamental right to privacy, is a waste of public money and worse, even can contribute to endangering women's safety. Today we were constrained to send them a legal notice to halt the project immediately. Read on for more details. 
</p>
<h3>A secretive process</h3>
<p>For a project costing more than 500 crores and impacting the privacy of millions living and visiting Delhi, there have been no open public consultations inviting comments and suggestions on the rules governing such cameras. There has also been no cost-benefit analysis, and the entire tendering process was done without the bid documents and the scope of work being made publicly accessible. 
</p>
<p>For instance details of the project were also not provided through our RTI request and the Delhi Government incorrectly claimed that such details were already available in the public domain, when in fact, they were not (<em>read the <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jwWPi8gApRwwmiB3mmnSqNndqVvajK0E/view?usp=sharing"">RTI request</a> and the <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l0k0J2i2kJM9f7M2EHvu7aGTmfndvMtI/view?usp=sharing"">reply here</a>). </em>For the record the complete details were not made available on the PWD website and even the Standard Operating Procedure for thier installation and operation has not been published in a proper manner. 
</p>
<h3>Assualt on privacy</h3>
<p>Hard fought battles of getting and implementing privacy as a fundamental right are now at risk in Delhi, where lakhs of CCTVs will now record each and every movement of citizens. According to one <a href=""http://www.iosrjournals.org/iosr-jhss/papers/Vol.%2023%20Issue12/Version-2/B2312020408.pdf"">survey</a> conducted on this issue, 210 out of 250 or 84% of the respondent students were concerned about the CCTV footage being used for stalking and personal abuse. 
</p>
<p>As per the Supreme Court’s decision in the right to privacy case (<em>Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India, (2017) 10 SCC 1</em>), the three core elements to gauge the legality of a privacy violation are, (a) legality; (b) legitimate state aim; and (c) proportionality. The CCTV project fails on all these three parameters. Also, for questioning Peters and doubting Thomases, several passages in the right to privacy judgement clearly hold that even information in public spaces has a privacy right attached to them. 
</p>
<h3>A voyuers dream, a stalkers paradise</h3>
<p>A one-page note providing the Standard Operating Procedure for such cameras makes the Resident Welfare Association nominee one of the primary custodians of the footage recorded. In the absence of any safeguards, this means that your local neighbourhood committee member can access and use any recordings collected from any cameras within the neighbourhood. 
</p>
<p>It can also lead to higher crime against women and issues of moral policing given that such unhindered, unregulated and liberal access to CCTV feeds will be provided to a unrestricted number of people. This will be done without any safeguards. When we say, ""without any"", we mean <strong>absolutely zero</strong>. 
</p>
<h3>Putting the Delhi Government to Notice</h3>
<p>All of these points are set out at length in a legal notice we sent today to the Hon’ble Chief Minister of Delhi (<a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tW6CsHuIWQN7K-MLgjmlij8o-T-rSRgf/view?usp=sharing"">Read the notice here</a>) demanding for a halt to such installations, opening up the proposal for public consultations and the addition of adequate safeguards to protect the privacy and freedom of millions of Delhi residents. Today, we remind the Government that Orwell's 1984 is work of fiction and caution, not an instruction manual. 
</p>
<p>We would like to thank Kritika Bhardwaj, Advocate, for her legal advice on this matter. IFF's work depends a large number of volunteer lawyers who bring their expertise and talent to secure digital rights. Greater impact to our efforts can be achieved by your support.

<p>As the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018 makes it way to Parliament, we showcase some of civil society's work in ensuring India has a well-established data protection framework. It is important that the current concerns with the law be addressed and to achieve this, we provide for a few steps of action that IFF will engage in through its continuing support funnelled through the SaveOurPrivacy campaign.
</p><img src=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Screenshot-2019-11-27-at-11.10.02-AM.png"" alt=""Screenshot-2019-11-27-at-11.10.02-AM.png#asset:12603"" /><h3>Some background Info</h3>
<p>In July 2017, the government of India appointed a Committee of Experts on a Data Protection Framework for India chaired by Justice (Retd.) B.N. Srikrishna. It purpose was study issues related to data protection in India; after which it provided a report which informed the proposed 'comprehensive' law on data protection that now graces us.
</p>
<p>This law has been a concern since it was birthed; it not only fails to include a mirade of significant aspects, but some of its content proves to be extremely problematic. It is pertinent that these worries be addressed not only with the intention of furthering privacy and data protection but especially due it being intensely tied to the brink of this fourth industrial revolution we find ourselves in. We have anchored the SaveOurPrivacy campaign that has numerous takes on the Bill, the right to privacy and issues that stem out of it (<a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/coverages"">Read here for more</a>). 
</p>
<h3>Our fight for Data Protection</h3>
<p>In our continuing work, we will seek to ensure the highest levels of data protection and surveillance reform through this law. Much of this will build off past work which will now provide a solid foundation to contrast the Government's bill with civil society efforts to ensure a synthesis of the best ideas and language in this law. 
</p>
<ol><li><strong>Engaging with Parliament: </strong>IFF has been consistently involved in ensuring that data protection finds its rightful place in India and this means it requires an all en-compassing legislative framework. An important chunk of this includes surveillance safeguards; the Bill in its current form makes no mention of this and as need for surveillance reform in India is close to our hearts, we encapsulate this in our work. Almost two years ago, with the help of our generous volunteers, we assisted the office of Dr. Shashi Tharoor, Lok Sabha, MP from Kerala in filing a user centric privacy bill in Parliament. This year, through Dr. Ravikumar Lok Sabha, MP from Tamil Nadu), a substantive redraft of the Indian Privacy Code created by the SaveOurPrivacy campaign was introduced in Parliament as 'Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019'(<a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/blog/personal-data-and-information-privacy-code-bill-2019-introduced-in-the-lok-sabha-today-saveourprivacy"">Read all about it here</a>). Both these Bills relied heavily on the 7 Privacy Principles the Indian Privacy Code was based on.
</li><li><strong>Advocacy with Ministries and Committees: </strong>Throughout the year, IFF has sent a number of representations to various Ministries and the Standing Committee of Information Technology highlighting the need for a data protection law to uphold the individual's right to privacy and especially for transparency in content of the Bill that is to be introduced as law (Read more about it). 
</li><li><strong>Leading on public awareness: </strong>Be it through our explainers, social media and even events (<em>remember <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/blog/privacysupreme"">#PrivacySupreme</a>, wasn't it fantastic?</em>), we understand the importance in growing awareness of the need for the protection of one's data.
</li><li><strong>Litigation: </strong>We hold the clear belief that any Data Protection effort in India will be incomplete without surveillance reform. The reality of protecting the informational privacy of Individuals in India requires both to walk together in lock step together. India cannot protect people from profiling and 360 degree profiles if a data protection law only seeks to regulate the consensual gathering of personal data but does not address and regulate survelliance activities of the State and even private parties. As surveillance reform is clearly important to us, IFF has even approached the Supreme Court on this need as we challenge interception powers of the Government (<a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/blog/supreme-court-issues-notice-on-iffs-petition-for-surveillance-reform-saveourprivacy-1"">Read here for more</a>).
</li></ol><h3>Continuing efforts</h3>
<p>Now that the Government proposes to introduce a Data Protection law in this Session of Parliament, we are concerned that we have become more concerned with the process (<em>that has brought a degree of impatience</em>) than the actual substance of the proposals. This is with good reason. It's been a long and ardous wait. However, there is little reason to proceed with haste given the importance of this legislative effort. 
</p>
<p>We are today more concerned with the substance of this proposed law, which has yet to be made public since the Srikrishna Committee first proposed it. There exists little transparency on its proposals and the changes which have been made over the course of the year (or, even if not made) are of tremendous concern and mystery. 
</p>
<p>With the public left completely in the dark with regard to its content, we intend to take a few measures to ensure concerns with the law are addressed: 
</p>
<ul><li><strong>Ensure referral: </strong>IFF will examine several options in our advocacy arsenal, to make sure the text of this bill is referred to the Standing Committee considering the lack of transparency and it is publicly unknown. We commit to working in partnership and collaborate with all civil society efforts, academics, experts and collectives. 
</li><li><strong>Persisting engagement:</strong> We will continue to work objectively to advance public interest. Through continued engagement with the Government in any way we can in upholding the right to privacy and the safeguards awarded through the data protection law. 
</li><li><strong>Focus on Individual rights: </strong>We will contiue to fight for you. There is a flood of technologies being used in a manner that violate individual rights. We will work tirelessly to ensure that each government programme, or private use impacting privacy is rights oriented by making sure dangerous proposals do not see the light of day.

<img src=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Because-your-boss-shouldnt-become-Big-Boss.png"" alt=""Because-your-boss-shouldnt-become-Big-Boss.png#asset:12683"" /><h3>Tl;dr</h3>
<p>IFF has prepared a public brief highlighting the impact of the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 on workplace surveillance. Technologies like CCTV cameras, location tracking and device monitoring have made it possible for employers to turn workplaces into a panopticon, and such pervasive surveillance undermines the dignity of labour and the ability of workers to unionise. We encourage you to read the brief and participate in the consultation being held by the Joint Parliamentary Committee to ensure existing power imbalances between workers and employers are not exacerbated by the Bill.
</p>
<h3>Your boss shouldn't be Big Boss</h3>
<p>Much has been written about the exemptions provided under the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 for governmental surveillance but there is another form of surveillance which the Bill permits that we should all be worried about. Clause 13 of the Bill exempts employers from seeking consent prior to processing personal data of their employees for recruitment and termination of employment, provision of services and benefits, verification of attendance and performance assessment. With advancement in technology, employers now have the ability to continuously monitor the real time activity of their employees through CCTV cameras, location tracking, device monitoring etc. By allowing employers to track bathroom breaks, lunch breaks and meetings of employees, such technologies pose a threat to the dignity of labour and the ability of workers to unionise. 
</p>
<h3>Recommendations </h3>
<p>In order to ensure that any workplace surveillance is strictly need based, context specific and minimize intrusion into the personal lives of employees, we recommend that the following changes are made to the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019.
</p>
<ol><li>The principles of necessity and proportionality should be included under Clause 13, PDP Bill 2019.
</li><li>A mandatory obligation should be imposed on the employer to consult employees and seek their views prior to processing personal data under Clause 13, PDP Bill 2019.
</li><li>The Data Protection Authority should be entrusted with the responsibility of issuing a Code of Practice for workplace surveillance under Clause 50, PDP Bill 2019.
</li><li>The Code of Practice for workplace surveillance issued by the Data Protection Authority should impose a prohibition on monitoring of any unionisation related activity and prescribe penalties for the same.
</li><li>Trade Union affiliation should be categorised as sensitive personal data under Clause 3(36), PDP Bill 2019.
</li></ol><h3>Read the public brief and engage with the JPC</h3>
<p>For more information, we encourge you to read our public brief on the impact of the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 on workplace surveillance. The brief highlights the impact of workplace surveillance on the fundamental right to unionise guaranteed by Article 19(1)(c) and the fundamental right to privacy guaranteed by Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. It further explains existing provisions relating to workplace surveillance under the Bill and discusses their pros and cons. Following from the earlier discussion, the brief finally recommends five changes to the Bill to ensure that the existing power imbalances between employers and employees are not exacerbated by pervasive workplace surveillance.

12853,"Essential Features of a Rights Respecting Data Protection Law",essential-features-of-a-rights-respecting-data-protection-law,,,admin,2020-02-28,,Yes,live,"Sidharth Deb","<img src=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/PDP-Main-Submission.png"" alt=""PDP-Main-Submission.png#asset:12852"" /><h3>Tl;dr</h3>
<p>IFF has responded to the call for public comments and suggestions by the Joint Committee on the Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill, 2019 and sent across a submission on behalf of the #SaveOurPrivacy campaign. In it we have provided substantive inputs on essential privacy principles and a thematic analysis of major issues with the Bill. We have also appended a public brief containing a high-level clause by clause analysis of the Bill. Additionally, we have appended two issue specific briefs on (a) workplace surveillance and (b) the relationship between the PDP Bill and the National Population Register. <br /></p>
<h3>Essential First Principles</h3>
<p>As a first step we apprised the Committee that since the right to privacy as recognised by the Supreme Court also includes informational privacy this should be the primary lens through which the eventual law should be framed. In this regard, we also mentioned that the Supreme Court in the right to privacy judgement (<em>KS Puttaswamy v Union of India</em>) made the observation that the right to privacy subsists in public spaces as well. In this regard, we highlighted that a lot of users’ experiences online occur in certain corners of the internet which are public/semi-public in nature. Therefore, India’s data protection law must respect that and therefore accord adequate privacy protections in these domains<br /></p>
<p>In addition, we noted that the Joint Committee could shape India’s data protection law to incorporate the <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/principles"">seven privacy principles</a> of the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 which was developed by the #SaveOurPrivacy campaign. These principles are based on the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s decision in KS Puttaswamy v Union of India and global examples like the European Union’s (EU’s) General Data Protection Regulation. The seven privacy principles emphasise that individual rights should be at the center of privacy and data protection and that the government should respect user privacy. They also address the need for the creation of a strong supervisory authority; and for surveillance reform. <br /></p>
<h3>Major Concerns that should be addressed by the Committee</h3>
<p>Subsequently we have done a thematic analysis of our top substantive concerns with the PDP Bill. This includes but is not limited to themes such as:<br /></p>
<p><em>1. <em><em>Inclusion and treatment of social media intermediaries in the Bill</em></em></em>
</p>
<p>The Bill requires social media platforms identified as “significant data fiduciaries” to set up infrastructure which allows users in India to voluntarily verify their accounts. This measure hampers online anonymity and thereby the right to privacy. Additionally, it will allow social media entities to access people's government issued identity documents. This can lead to aggregation of demographic information across different social media companies and databases. This creates immense scope for companies to build granular user profiles and commercialise personal and sensitive personal data of individuals. <strong>We therefore ask the Committee to remove this provision from the PDP Bill</strong>.<br /></p>
<p><em>2. <em><em>Need for a chapter on surveillance reform</em></em></em>
</p>
<p>Presently, India does not have sufficient privacy safeguards in place when it comes to surveillance carried out by the government. The frameworks currently in place (under India’s Information Technology Act and the Telegraph Act) are geared towards national security and fail to adequately protect privacy. In particular there is a lack of sufficient institutional or legislative oversight. <strong>Thus, we have proposed that there is a need for a separate chapter on surveillance reform in the Bill along the lines of the Indian Privacy Code, 2018</strong>.<br /></p>
<p><em>3. <em><em>Exceptions for central government to access non-personal data</em></em></em>
</p>
<p>A provision in the PDP Bill (Clause 91) provides a carve-out for the Central Government to access anonymised or non-personal data to frame policies in the interest of its digital economy. Such provisions show that the proposed law is far more interested in treating data as a resource. <strong>We believe that a data protection law should not be used as a legislative backdoor to commodify data</strong>.<br /></p>
<p><em>4. Issues with proposed structure of the Data Protection Authority (DPA) and the accompanying appellate structure</em>
</p>
<ul><li>The selection committee consists of secretary-level officials. Two issues that arise here are of: i) accountability (these are neither democratically elected nor judicial members), and ii) diversity (it doesn’t reflect executive, judicial and external expertise). <strong>Thus, we have proposed having an open call for applications and for the selection committee to have be inclusive in terms of representation</strong>.
</li><li>We have noted that the Bill <strong>impairs the independence of the DPA </strong>by allowing the Government to frame policies which will be binding on them.
</li><li>To ensure quicker and localised decision making, we have proposed having <strong>state and regional DPA benches</strong>.
</li><li>We think that as things stand, the Appellate Tribunal would lack transparency. To that end, we have <strong>proposed that it must publish all its decisions</strong>. <br /></li></ul><p><em>5. <em><em>The “reasonable purposes” exemption which allows personal data to be processed without consent for reasonable purposes under Clause 14 of the Bill.</em></em></em>
</p>
<p>The exemptions granted under this clause are fairly wide. It classifies publicly available personal data as under the “<strong>reasonable purposes</strong>” category. We think that this is a backdoor towards profiling and allow collation of demographic/individual sentiments on issues. We also think this would allow the government (and other powerful data fiduciaries) to aggregate social networking activities without the need for individual consent. The right to privacy is applicable in public spaces. Therefore, we proposed that this <strong>provision be removed from the reasonable purposes exception since it is an excessive encroachment on people’s privacy in public spaces</strong>.<br /></p>
<p>In addition to these themes, there are also other major issues with the Bill that we have discussed at length in our submission. The #SaveOurPrivacy collective has also authored briefs and explainers on different areas of the PDP Bill. We are sharing them with the JPC, the public and other relevant stakeholders in the hope that our analysis can inform future outcomes.<br /></p>

<p>As part of its submission to the Joint Parliamentary Committee evaluating the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019, IFF has sent a brief analysing the impact of the Bill on the National Population Register. The brief highlights how the National Population Register violates data protection principles of lawfulness, consent, purpose limitation, data minimization and accountability. Based on this case study, the brief identifies various loopholes in the Bill and recommends necessary changes.
</p>
<h3>The Database Republic</h3>
<p><img src=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/NPR-Timeline.png"" alt=""NPR-Timeline.png#asset:12854"" /><br /></p><p>The National Population Register has been in the headlines during the ongoing protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act but the project has a long and interesting history. Originally proposed in 2001 in the aftermath of the Kargil War to address concerns of cross-border infiltration, the project was accelerated after the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks. Household surveys were conducted in 2010 for NPR, and demographic data, biometric data and other government identifiers were collected from the population. It is important to note biometrics and government identifiers are sensitive personal data and their misuse can cause significant harm to an individual.
</p>
<p>While there was an initial tussle between UIDAI and the Registrar General over whose database will have primacy, this was resolved by the Cabinet Committee on UID in 2010 with the Government deciding that the Registrar General will issue Aadhaar cards instead of Multi-Purpose National Identity Cards. In 2015, NPR was updated and seeded with Aadhaar numbers. The Election Commission also wanted Voter ID details to be mandatorily included in NPR so it could link Voter IDs with Aadhaar through this mechanism. Earlier in 2011, NPR data was used as the basis for the Socio-Economic Caste Census because the Census Act, 1948 prohibited census data from being used. Therefore, NPR became the channel to achieve what could not be done through databases which had higher levels of data protection.
</p>
<h3>Recommendations</h3>
<p>We analysed the NPR project against data protection principles recognized by the Supreme Court in the landmark judgement of <em>K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India</em> and found that it fell short on several aspects.
</p>
<p><img src=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/NPR-Problems.png"" alt=""NPR-Problems.png#asset:12855"" /><br /></p><p>Based on this case study, we recommend the following changes should be made to the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 to fix loopholes which could lead to a disproportionate encroachment on individual privacy.
</p>
<ul><li>Clause 5 of the PDP Bill should state that only those purposes which are clearly mentioned in the primary legislation enacted by Parliament will qualify as a valid purpose for collection and processing of personal data if the government is building a database. 
</li><li>Clause 35 of the PDP Bill should include principles of necessity and proportionality and mandate independent judicial oversight prior to any exemption being granted by the Central Government. This would also be consonant with the proportionality standard endorsed by the Supreme Court in <em>K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2017 10 SCC 1).</em> In any case, exemption from application of the entire PDP Bill should not be permitted and certain minimal requirements like preservation of quality and integrity of data and adherence to security standards should be required even under Clause 35.
</li><li>Clause 38 of the PDP Bill should be restructured and sub-clauses (d) and (e) should be incorporated as provisos which will serve as a pre-condition for grant of exemption for statistical purposes.

<p><strong>TL:DR</strong></p>
<p>This is a new series on the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 to deal exclusively with the issues and pathways for reform under the Bill. Will the bill serve ordinary Indians, or the government and large corporations is a big issue dominating our minds. To clear this up we need the law, to have clear objectives that record what is a priority. People, or profit. Unfortunately the Preamble of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 engages in some hand waving and tries an awkward balancing exercise that is inconsistent with principles of data protection. 
</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>Over the course of the last few weeks, we had provided a series of explainers on various facets of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. In <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/startfromscratch-the-data-bill-series-part-1/"">part 1</a>, we gave an introduction to the Bill and provided some historical context to data protection in India; in <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/startfromscratch-an-explainer-on-the-personal-data-protection-bill-2019/"">part 2</a>, we explained the key definitions and clauses of the Bill; in <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/why-is-the-data-bill-being-criticized/"">part 3</a>, we briefly touched upon the various issues with the Bill; and in <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/constitutional-utopias-of-digital-protection/"">part 4</a>, we looked at alternative paradigms of data protection legislation.
</p>
<p>In this new series #DataProtectionTop10, we wish to discuss the concerns surrounding the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. Unlike part 3 of our #StartFromScratch series, which was more of a sneak peak, this series aims at pulling out important issues related to the Bill and dissecting each one in detail. As the issues with the Bill start right from its beginning, this post will delve into the concerns around the Preamble of the Bill. 
</p>
<p><strong>THE ISSUE: LACK OF CLARITY ON THE OBJECTIVES</strong></p>
<p>Behind every law, there is a purpose. This purpose constitutes the objectives of a statute (a statute is basically an act of parliament). They are set out at the very beginning of a statute in its preamble. These ultimate objectives anchor the interpretation of the statute and hold together the various provisions in it. The preamble along with the objectives of a statute will tell you what the lawmakers are trying to achieve through that particular legislation. 
</p>
<p>At the end of the day, a strong data protection regime has to be clear on what it is trying to achieve. Determining the objective of a data protection legislation is no easy task, mainly due to the unique nature of the data and the interests of the State involved in the regulation of the data. Data has long since been seen as what belongs to you or what information you generate and is now a valuable commodity in the market. The commodification of data in this highly technology-driven world has presented two conflicting choices before policymakers: protection of information privacy of the citizens, and fostering the data economy of the country. </p><p>The founding document of the Personal Data Protection Bill; the <a href=""https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Data_Protection_Committee_Report.pdf"">Sri Krishna Committee report</a> throws light on what the considerations should be in formulating a legal framework on data protection which would work as a template for the developing world. The report states that the protection of personal data holds the key to empowerment, progress, and innovation. It also notes that any such legal framework on data protection should be not only for India, but for Indians. Such a framework should also understand from the ground up the particular concerns and aspirations pertaining to personal data shared by Indians, their fears, and hopes. However, this draft Bill and the report by the Sri Krishna Committee was also disappointing for it brought into priority issues of promotion of data side businesses along with data protection. A good way to think about this is to pose a question. Will legislation or law for, let’s say, protection of the environment (like the Air Act) also in its preamble mark an equal priority for the promotion of industries?</p>
<p><strong>THE CONCERN: </strong>
</p>
<p>Now that we have the second draft of the Bill, in the form of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, it is pertinent to analyse whether these were the considerations that influenced the drafters of the Bill, or if they were influenced by some other objectives. From the preamble of the Bill, we can discern that the primary objective of the Bill is to create a collective culture which promotes a free and fair digital economy, progress, and innovation while respecting informational privacy. This essentially means that the PDP Bill aims to promote digital economy of India through data protection legislation. This leads us to the obvious question: how does the protection of information privacy fit in this matrix?</p>
<p>Rather than prioritising the informational privacy of individuals over the economic benefits of data, the PDP Bill 2019 <a href=""https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-data-protection-bill-only-weakens-user-rights/article30405339.ece"">places these two competing and contradicting goals on the same footing</a>. The natural consequence that flows from this is that the informational privacy of Indians, which should have been the primary objective of the PDP Bill gets sidetracked. In addition to this, because of the ambiguity in the primary objective of the data protection law, the balancing of competing interests also gets messy. 
</p>
<p>The preamble also appears to have failed to mention the need for protecting the right to privacy of individuals from one of the powerful and biggest processors of personal data: the State. The right to privacy, being a fundamental right, is essentially a right that is available to us against the State. The State has a duty to not intrude into the personal lives of individuals and to protect the privacy of individuals. Furthermore, in these times, where <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/tag/watchthewatchmen/"">State-sponsored mass surveillance</a> runs rife, it is important to state in clear terms in the preamble of a data protection law that it is applicable to the State - the primary focus of the Bill should be on protecting the data and informational privacy of individuals from both the State as well as private actors. </p>
<p><strong>SOLUTIONS: CLEARER OBJECTIVES TO SECURE YOUR DIGITAL RIGHTS</strong></p>
<p>The problems with the objectives of the PDP Bill, 2019 become more glaring when we compare it with the <a href=""https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679"">GDPR</a>, which sets the standard for comprehensive data protection laws, or the two private member Bills which we discussed in <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/constitutional-utopias-of-digital-protection/"">Part 4 </a>of the #StartfromScratch series: the Data Privacy and Protection Bill, 2017 and The Personal Data and Information Privacy Code, 2019.
</p>
<p>The objectives of GDPR are enshrined in the recitals. The recitals <a href=""https://www.americanbar.org/groups/litigation/committees/minority-trial-lawyer/practice/2019/a-very-brief-introduction-to-the-gdpr-recitals/"">set the context and objectives of the GDPR, and supplements the articles</a>. <a href=""https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-4/"">Recital 4</a> of the GDPR starts by stating that the processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind. The recitals acknowledge that individuals should have the <a href=""https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-7/"">control of their own personal data. </a> The need for the development of the digital economy is also addressed by the GDPR. The recitals note that a <a href=""https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-7/"">strong and coherent data protection framework </a>is required, for this would foster the trust that is essential for the development of the digital economy. 
</p>
<p>Economic benefits of data and development of the data economy find no place in the objectives of the <a href=""http://164.100.47.4/billstexts/lsbilltexts/asintroduced/1121.pdf"">Data Privacy and Protection Bill, 2017</a> and <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DReq96e-FLsSoKUvK94_-VCtu2Y1PE97/view"">The Personal Data and Information Privacy Code, 2019</a>. These Bills place the protection of informational privacy of the individuals from private actors as well as the State at the heart of the data protection framework and based on these objectives devise an individual-centric, rights based data protection regime.
</p>
<p>Fostering the digital economy is indeed a legitimate interest of the State, but it should not become a playground for the trade-off of informational privacy for innovation and economic growth. In our <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P2qopI6NOQb5xWAf6z7xYr2lR-8xQbEx_92reULREA0/edit"">comments submitted to the Sri Krishna Committee,</a> we had highlighted this very fact; that a data protection law must place individuals at its centre, and their interest should be paramount, especially when weighed against state expectations or commercial interests.
</p>
<p>The first out of the <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/principles"">7 privacy principles</a> states that the protection of the right to privacy of the individuals promotes innovation in a sustainable way. This essentially means that the right to privacy of individuals should be the means to promote innovation. The efficient use of data and adherence to the principles of data protection will help businesses in <a href=""https://www.digitalistmag.com/cio-knowledge/2019/07/17/innovation-vs-data-privacy-or-innovation-data-privacy-06199461/"">gaining and retaining the trust of customers</a>, and loyal customers equals the good growth of businesses. 
</p>
<p>The other related concerns regarding innovation etc. can be addressed through suitable compliant norms, once a data protection law and its modalities are in place. Thus, the objective of the Personal Data Protection Bill must be restated in unambiguous terms, affirming that the overriding objective of the Bill is the protection of data and informational privacy of the individuals from both private as well as State actors. Doing so would ensure that data protection regimes in India remain focused on the user and provide us, the citizens of India, with control over our own data!

<p>In post 2 of the #DataProtectionTop10 series, we discuss in detail yet another issue with the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 - the preference given to the private sector and State over your data protection. This basically allows them to profit over your personal data without your consent! Here we first examine the provisions in the Bill on government access to non-personal data and setting up of privacy sandboxes, and then discuss potential changes that could be made to include a more rights-based perspective on non-personal data.
</p>
<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>Picking up where we left off in <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectiontop10-lost-in-muddled-objectives/"">Part 1</a> of this series on the issues with the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, this post is a continuation of previously raised concerns. The muddled objectives of the Bill have resulted in the inclusion of some provisions that do not really fit into the rubric of data protection. Hence, in this post, we shall discuss these provisions and how they affect the privacy of the people. So, without any further ado, let’s get started!
</p>
<h3>THE ISSUE: THE USE AND MISUSE OF NON-PERSONAL DATA</h3>
<p>The provision that we are concerned with is Section 91 of the Bill. According to the Section, the Central Government can frame policies for the promotion of digital economy so long as the policy does not cover personal data. However, it does not stop there; the Section goes on to state that the Central government can, after consulting the Data Protection Authority, direct any data fiduciary or data processor to share any anonymised personal data or other non-personal data to enable better targeting of delivery of services or formulation of evidence-based policies. 
</p>
<p>Before we dive into the issues with the provision, we need to understand non-personal data and anonymised personal data. Anonymised data is such data that meets the standard of irreversibility or anonymisation as prescribed by the authority, and is in a form in which the data principal cannot be de-identified as per the prescribed standards of irreversibility. To begin with, anonymised data has been exempted from all the other provisions of the Bill. Till here, things seem to be fine. But what becomes a bit more concerning, is “non-personal data” that has been very conveniently defined under the Bill as any data other than personal data. The definition of non-personal data given under the Bill is problematic as it does not provide any clarity on what it actually is and how it can be delineated from personal data. We have discussed at length the problems with distinguishing between personal data and non-personal data in <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/unconstitutional-draft-report-on-non-personal-data-ignores-concerns-about-privacy-and-data-monopolies/"">our comments to the draft framework for the governance of non-personal data. </a>In that we have highlighted that non-personal data is a very ambiguous concept and that ascertaining the degree of identifiability of a data-point can be a convoluted process in the context of both implementation and jurisprudence.
</p>
<p>Similarly, the definition of anonymised personal data is also <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf"">not comprehensive, and it does not address the possibility of identification of the individuals</a>. A seemingly innocuous non-personal data or anonymised data when combined with other datasets can cause the deleterious effect of <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf"">de-identification and targeting of the individuals</a> to whom the data pertains. The threat of de-identification of anonymised data and the consequent violation of privacy of individuals is very grave as the underlying data is personal data.
</p>
<p>Despite the concerns raised by non-personal data and anonymised data, the Government still wants access to them. It appears that the only possible rationale for this approach of the Government is that it sees <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/essential-features-of-a-rights-respecting-data-protection-law/"">data as a resource</a> which needs to be harnessed at any rate for the growth of the digital economy of the country. What is equally worrying is that Section 91 serves as kind of an exemption to the Government which grants it the power to demand non-personal data or anonymised data from data fiduciaries and use it however they want, without having any regard for the security of the underlying personal data.
</p>
<h3>SANDBOXES TO PLAY WITH YOUR DATA!</h3>
<p>By making provision for sandboxes lacking adequate safeguards for personal data protection, the Bill peaks at favouring businesses and the growth of the digital economy over the protection of informational privacy of individuals. A regulatory sandbox is set up for the testing of new products or services under a controlled environment with relaxation in certain regulatory requirements. A <a href=""https://biac.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Final-Business-at-OECD-Analytical-Paper-Regulatory-Sandboxes-for-Privacy.pdf"">data sandbox</a> is where data is accessed and analysed in an isolated environment. It gives the innovators access to sensitive and proprietary data while respecting the privacy and intellectual property rights of the rights holders. The Bill creates a provision for sandboxes in order to encourage innovation in artificial intelligence, machine-learning or other emerging technology in public interest.
</p>
<p>This provision is worrisome; firstly because<a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf""> the term ‘sandbox’ is not defined anywhere in the Bill</a>. Secondly, it falls under chapter VIII, which provides for exemptions from the provisions of the Bill. The necessary implication of this is that data fiduciaries get exemption from the core data protection principles such as consent, purpose specification, collection limitation, and storage limitation. Such exemptions could have detrimental effects on the right to privacy of the individuals.
</p>
<h3>SOLUTION: A RIGHTS-BASED APPROACH TO NON-PERSONAL DATA</h3>
<p>The provisions for Government access to non-personal data and privacy sandbox are unique to the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. The fundamental considerations behind these provisions are the economic interests of the State, and thus it is a stark deviation from the ultimate objective of data protection legislation: the protection of informational privacy of individuals. Thus, these provisions must be deleted.
</p>
<p>We had voiced similar concerns when we provided <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/unconstitutional-draft-report-on-non-personal-data-ignores-concerns-about-privacy-and-data-monopolies/"">our submission</a> on the second version of the Draft Report of the Committee of Experts on Non-Personal Data Governance Framework. In our submission, we had recommended that:
</p>
<ol><li>Non-personal data be regulated under the Data Protection Authority proposed by the PDPB. Doing so would shift the focus onto the protection of citizens’ digital rights and ensure robust regulatory mechanisms for NPD. Questions about the fostering of growth in the sector can then be handled in consonance with an approach that safeguards user data.
</li><li>Doing so would also strengthen institutional independence, reduce confusion and minimise the potential risks and faulty premises adopted by the second version of the Draft Non-Personal Data Report. This becomes necessary in light of issues of the ease of de-anonymisation, since a proactive approach in which robust guidelines for anonymisation procedures are mandated and enforced (in addition to any retroactive procedures) may be better equipped to deal with the emerging threats posed by de-anonymisation.
</li><li>Subsequently, the Data Protection Authority must junk an approach that directly enables the over-extraction of data and the formation of data monopolies, and create a model that centres the governance framework around the protection of user privacy, based on the Puttaswamy judgement on the Fundamental Right to Privacy.

<p>In part 3 of the #DataProtectionTop10 series, we look into various issues regarding the consent provisions for the processing of personal data under the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. The provisions under the Bill for processing of data without the consent of data principals are vague and undermine the right to privacy. Furthermore, the lack of clarity on the consequences for withdrawal of consent can even result in the denial of essential services. To address these issues, we suggest certain changes that must be incorporated into the wording of the Bill. 
</p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong><br /></p>
<p>Last time in <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectiontop10-imposters-under-the-personal-data-protection-bill/"">part 2</a>, we looked at how non-personal data could be processed by various entities without user consent. This time, we will look at how the Bill treats consent in general. Consent is the cornerstone of a robust data protection regime. Consent places the control of personal data with its owners. It gives you the choice to determine whether or not to be subjected to certain types of processing of data. The consent contemplated under the Bill is ‘informed and meaningful’ consent. Consent is said to be <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/startfromscratch-an-explainer-on-the-personal-data-protection-bill-2019/"">valid</a> under the Bill if it is; given freely, informed, specific, clearly expressed, and is capable of being withdrawn. While these provisions appear well-grounded<strong>,</strong> there are certain carve-outs to consent under the Bill such as exceptions to the State, employers, etc., which make them less effective and debilitate user’s control over their personal data. It is thus important for us to examine the exceptions to consent under the Bill and understand how it affects our rights under the Bill.</p>
<p><strong><strong>THE ISSUE: OVERBROAD EXCEPTIONS</strong></strong><br /></p>
<p>The exceptions to consent begin with clause 12, which inter alia allows the State to process personal data without the consent of data principals for certain purposes, such as for providing services, benefits, or for the issuance of any certification, licence, or permit for any action or activity of the data principal. The exceptions to State under clause 12 essentially legitimise the collection and processing of personal data by the State for projects like Aadhar. 
</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Data_Protection_Committee_Report.pdf"">Sri Krishna Committee report</a> emphasises the need to restrict the exception given to the State for carrying out welfare and regulatory functions to only those entities which are performing functions directly connected to such activities. The report warns that a large part of the functioning of various departments of the government may be indirectly or remotely connected to the promotion of public welfare or regulatory functions, and this ground should not be used for justifying the processing of personal data for all such functions. In this context, the Committee made the recommendation that the availability of this exception should be restricted to certain entities of the State and certain functions to avoid vagueness in the law. However, from the text of clause 12 we can discern that such restrictions are missing. 
</p>
<p>The processing of data by the State is prescribed under <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/principles"">Principle 4</a> of the Indian Privacy Code, a progressive and rights-based data protection legislation based on multistakeholder collaboration with data protection experts and lawyers. The Code states that the government is responsible for the delivery of many essential services to the public of India and that individuals cannot be forced to trade away their data at the altar of being permitted to use government services and access legal entitlements on welfare. Therefore, any provision which allows the State to collect personal data for providing services or benefits, should not be vague and should respect the informational privacy of the data principals.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>DENIAL OF SERVICES BASED ON A LACK OF CONSENT</strong></p>
<p>Though the Bill does not explicitly state that services can be denied to the data principals for want of consent, there are some provisions under the Bill, which when read together, can lead to denial of services. The provisions on consent are set out under clause 11, which inter alia states that the provision of any goods or services, or the performance of any contract, or the enjoyment of any legal right or claim, should not be denied on the ground that no consent was obtained for the processing of any personal data not necessary for that purpose. In the same breath, the clause also states that if the data principal withdraws their consent from the processing of any personal data without any valid reason, all legal consequences for the effects of such withdrawal will have to be borne by such data principal. This clause is very vaguely worded as there is no clarity on what amounts to a valid reason and what are the legal consequences that the data principals will have to face. Since there is no express bar on denial of essential services, it is possible that such <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf"">legal consequences may also include denial of essential services</a>. This is a valid concern, for instances of exclusion from essential services are plenty in the country. We have already seen this during the ongoing pandemic, as Aadhaar has been made mandatory for the receipt of several healthcare services such as <a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/aadhaar-rule-for-hospital-beds-leaves-many-stumped/articleshow/82188572.cms"">hospital beds</a>, <a href=""https://www.thequint.com/my-report/denied-covid-19-test-due-to-aadhaar-id-proof"">COVID-19 tests</a>, and <a href=""https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/covid-19-doorstep-delivery-of-oxygen-cylinders-in-gurgaon-from-sunday-7307124/"">oxygen cylinder</a>s. Patients have even been <a href=""https://health.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/hospitals/girl-denied-treatment-in-delhi-govt-hospital-over-aadhaar-union-minister-comes-to-rescue/66175841"">denied healthcare</a> in certain cases.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>EMPLOYERS AS BIG BROTHER</strong></p>
<p>Workplace surveillance has become a <a href=""https://cis-india.org/internet-governance/blog/the-boss-will-see-you-now-the-growth-of-workplace-surveillance-in-india-is-data-protection-legislation-the-answer"">common feature of workspaces across India</a> in recent times, with the increased use of <a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-employers-are-using-new-tech-to-track-those-working-from-home/articleshow/74978786.cms"">CCTV cameras</a>, <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/legal-notice-to-becil-for-its-tender-to-procure-employee-tracking-smartwatches-and-a-mass-surveillance-system/"">biometric attendance systems</a>, and <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/legal-notice-to-becil-for-its-tender-to-procure-employee-tracking-smartwatches-and-a-mass-surveillance-system/"">other technologies</a> being reported. The use of such pervasive technologies is undesirable and we have always <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/workers-privacy-during-covid-19/"">voiced our dissent</a> against their use. The Bill does not do much to allay workplace surveillance, as clause 13 of the Bill exempts employers from obtaining the consent of the employees for the purposes of recruitment or termination of employees, for delivering services to employees, for verifying the attendance of employees, or for the assessment of the performance of the employees. This exception is available only if seeking the consent of the data principal would be inappropriate given the employer-employee relationship or would involve a disproportionate amount of effort on the part of the data fiduciary due to the nature of the processing involved in the clause. 
</p>
<p>The exception given to employers is broad and poses a grave threat to the privacy of the employees. Here, it is important to refer to <a href=""https://gdpr-info.eu/art-88-gdpr/"">Article 88</a> of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which deals with processing of data in the context of employment. The Article affords more protection to the data and informational privacy of the employees. It formulates that any rule for the processing of the data of employees in the context of employment should have specific measures to safeguard the human dignity, legitimate interests, and fundamental rights of employees, especially with regard to transparency of processing and workplace monitoring systems.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, this exception can lead to violation of the fundamental rights of the employees guaranteed under the Constitution of India. In our <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qjZfNEZjr9ohtGzMXsulzmgsrKXma-Rf/view"">public brief on workplace surveillance</a>, we have deliberated how workplace surveillance violates the fundamental rights of the employees. Workplace surveillance can aggravate the existing power imbalance between employees and employers, and can adversely impact the fundamental right of employees to form associations or unions guaranteed under Article 19(1)(c) of the Constitution. Also, it is needless to say, the use of pervasive surveillance technologies by employers could amount to disproportionate encroachment on the fundamental right to privacy guaranteed under Articles 14, 19, and 21 of the Constitution.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>HOW REASONABLE ARE THE ‘REASONABLE PURPOSES’ FOR PROCESSING OF DATA?</strong>
</p>
<p>Clause 14 of the Bill allows the processing of personal data without our consent for certain purposes that are considered as “reasonable”. This is a <a href=""https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Data_Protection_Committee_Report.pdf"">residuary clause</a> to cover the grounds that are useful to the society but are not covered by the grounds for non-consensual processing of data enumerated in Chapter III of the Bill. The Bill also gives a suggestive list of grounds of processing personal data that would amount to reasonable purposes. We find certain grounds contained therein as concerning. 
</p>
<p>The Bill includes publicly available personal data as one of the reasonable purposes for processing of personal data without consent. This exception stems from the fundamentally flawed notion that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in public places. We believe that this ground can become a <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/essential-features-of-a-rights-respecting-data-protection-law/"">backdoor to profiling of individuals.</a> The government as well as the big techs would no longer require the consent of individuals for aggregating their social networking activities and their sentiments on various issues. 
</p>
<p>Another interesting ground that has found place under reasonable purposes is the operation of search engines. This was not present in the previous draft of the Bill. The reason for its inclusion remains unknown. The operations of search engines range from simple indexing to profiling of users. The extent and scope of operations of search engines that would constitute a reasonable purpose is not clear.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION: CLEAR DEFINITIONS, LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, AND CLARITY</strong></p>
<p>It is no doubt that certain exceptions are necessary in order to facilitate a functional data protection regime. However, as we have mentioned in the <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/principles"">second principle of the Indian Privacy Code</a>, these exceptions can, if not worded clearly, end up swallowing the rule. Therefore, any exception should be worded clearly, limited in purpose, necessary and proportionate to the aim, and accompanied by sufficient procedural safeguards. Therefore, to prevent the abuse of the exceptions to the processing of data without consent, all such exceptions must be in line with these safeguards.
</p>
<p>The Bill should also provide in <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf"">explicit terms that essential services cannot be denied</a> for want of personal data or at the very least be based on the impossibility of providing the service. Further, for processing of data in the context of employment, as we have previously stated in our <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qjZfNEZjr9ohtGzMXsulzmgsrKXma-Rf/view"">public brief on workplace surveillance</a>, information regarding trade union affiliation, which can be used by employers to target employees, should be categorised as sensitive personal data to put the processing of such data out of the purview of the exception under clause 13 of the Bill. The principles of necessity and proportionality as articulated in the <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/91938676/""><em>Justice KS Puttaswamy vs Union of India</em></a> judgement of the Supreme Court on right to privacy should be incorporated into clause 13 so that the employers will be forced to resort to less privacy intrusive employee monitoring programmes, necessary to protect the interest of the employers and to thwart the risks to them. Further, the Data Protection Authority, which is the regulatory body proposed by the Bill, should be entrusted with the responsibility of issuing a Code of Practice for workplace surveillance under clause 50 of the Bill. Employees must be consulted and their views must be sought before processing personal data under clause 13 of the Bill. It is important to incorporate these safeguards into the Bill to ensure that consent, which is the bedrock of our data protection regime, is secure.

<p>In part 4 of the #DataProtectionTop10 series, we explore the issues with the user rights granted under the Bill and the provisions that affect the effective exercise of these rights. Certain rights under the Bill, specifically, the right to correction and erasure and the right to data portability are not absolute and contain significant exemptions. The Bill also fails to include certain rights like the right to object to the processing of certain personal data and the right to seek exemption from automated decision making. To address these concerns, we recommend certain changes to strengthen the rights of users.
</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Last time around, in <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectiontop10-exceptions-to-consent-a-torn-safety-net/"">part 3</a>, we looked at how the consent architecture operated under the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. In this post, we will be looking at the various rights granted to users under the Bill and the issues with them.
</p>
<p>In a data protection regime which claims to be rights-based, it is imperative that the users are given certain rights against the data fiduciaries. These rights are essential for the users to exercise control over their personal data. As we had noted in our <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/startfromscratch-an-explainer-on-the-personal-data-protection-bill-2019/"">explainer on the Bill</a>, Chapter V of the Bill grants users the following rights:
</p>
<ol><li>Right to confirmation and access: Users have the right to obtain their personal data as well as a summary of activities performed upon their data in a clear and concise manner.
</li><li>Right to correction and erasure: Users have the right to correct, complete, and update their personal data. Users also have the right to erase their personal data after it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was processed
</li><li>Right to Data Portability: Users have the right to receive and have transferred to any other fiduciary their personal data as well as any data generated during the provision of services.
</li><li>Right to be Forgotten: Users have the right to restrict or prevent the disclosure of their personal data if it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected or if they withdraw their consent.
</li></ol><p>While it is true that these rights empower the users and protect them, the Bill also creates certain impediments to the exercise of these rights. Therefore, it is important that we discuss the issues with the rights available to the users under the Bill, as well as the provisions that make the exercise of the rights cumbersome.
</p>
<h3>The issue: Significant exemptions that curtail users' rights</h3>
<p>The right to correction, completion, updation and erasure of personal data is contained in clause 18 of the Bill. This right is important as it enables the users<a href=""https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Data_Protection_Committee_Report.pdf""> to ensure the accuracy of the personal data</a> that they gave to the data fiduciaries, as well as the data that the data fiduciaries use to create profiles or arrive at certain conclusions about the users. However, this right is not absolute. Data fiduciaries can reject requests for correction, completion, updation or erasure of personal data if they disagree with such requests. Given that this right is also an integral part of the data fiduciary’s obligation to maintain the quality of data, the data fiduciaries should not be given the power to reject the requests of users unilaterally.
</p>
<p>Clause 19 contains the right to data portability, which enables the users to receive their personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. Like the right to correction and erasure, this right is also conditional, as the data fiduciary may deny a request for data portability on the grounds of technical infeasibility or protection of a trade secret. A request cannot be denied on the ground that the compliance with the request would reveal a trade secret of the data fiduciary, as personal data is not a trade secret that belongs to any data fiduciary, rather, it belongs to the users and control over it is a fundamental right of the users. There is no option for the users to challenge the decision of the data fiduciary when the request is rejected on the ground of technical infeasibility.
</p>
<h3>What rights are missing?</h3>
<p>The Bill has left out a few important rights like the right to object to processing of certain personal data and the right to seek exemption from automated decision making. The right to seek exemption from automated decision making includes the <a href=""https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Data_Protection_Committee_Report.pdf"">right to object to automated decision-making and to access the logic behind such decisions.</a> The object of this right is to protect the users against the prejudice and discrimination that results from algorithmic decision-making without any human intervention. Moreover, automated decision making affects the autonomy of users negatively.
</p>
<p>This is a right guaranteed under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a benchmark rights respecting data protection legislation. <a href=""https://gdpr-info.eu/art-22-gdpr/"">Article 22</a> of the GDPR gives the users the right not to be subjected to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects on them. We have seen in recent years how entities like Ola and Uber use algorithmic pricing and profiling to discriminate against their customers. Therefore, it is important that we have the right to seek exemption from automated decision-making and profiling in our data protection law.
</p>
<p>The right to object to the processing of personal data for direct marketing and related profiling is another right that is present in the GDPR (<a href=""https://gdpr-info.eu/art-21-gdpr/"">Article 21</a>) but is absent in our data protection law. The rationale behind the exclusion of such a provision from the Bill, as can be gathered from the Sri Krishna Committee report, is that direct marketing can be done only with the consent of the users. Hence, if the users do not consent to direct marketing, the data fiduciaries cannot approach the users for the same. Consent provisions are not unique to the Personal Data Protection Bill, it serves as the foundation of the GDPR as well. Yet the right to object to the processing of personal data for direct marketing exists only under one!
</p>
<h3>Solution: Strengthen user rights!</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen user protection, it is also important that the users are given mandatory notice in the event of data breaches. Clause 25 provides that in case of a breach of data, the data fiduciary shall inform the Data Protection Authority, as soon as possible, where such breach is likely to cause harm to any data principal. Furthermore, the section leaves it to the determination of the Data Protection Authority, whether the users should be notified of the breach. Thus, the data fiduciaries are denied the opportunity to inform the users of breaches even if they wish to and the users are denied their right to be informed of breaches to their personal data.
</p>
<p>According to the <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/principles"">first principle</a> of the Indian Privacy Code, individual rights should be at the centre of privacy and data protection. Therefore, the <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf"">rights of users under the Bill have to be reviewed</a> to ensure that the right to privacy of users gets primacy and the interests of data fiduciaries are addressed through limited exceptions. The Bill should make the disclosure of data breaches to users the rule rather than the exception. Rights such as the right to object to the processing of certain personal data and the right to seek exemption from automated decision-making have to be included in the Bill to protect the users from the challenges of emerging technologies.

<p>In Part 5 of the #DataProtectionTop10 series, we analyse the various issues with the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 with respect to social media platforms. The classification of social media intermediaries into significant data fiduciaries is based on vague and broad grounds. Additionally, the collection of identity documents for the verification of user accounts is against the principles of data protection and violates the informational privacy of the users. Thus, we recommend that the relevant clauses be removed.
</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>We are half-way through the series! Here is a quick recap of the series so far. In <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectiontop10-lost-in-muddled-objectives/"">Part 1</a> of the series we discussed the lack of clarity on the objectives of the preamble of Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 and in <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectiontop10-imposters-under-the-personal-data-protection-bill/"">Part 2</a> we saw how this has lead to the inclusion of certain provisions in the Bill which give preference to the private sector and commercial interests of the State over the protection of personal data of the users. In <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectiontop10-exceptions-to-consent-a-torn-safety-net/"">Part 3</a> we explained how certain exceptions to consent under the Bill violate the informational privacy of individuals. In <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectiontop10-on-the-need-to-protect/"">Part 4</a> we delved into the issues with the rights granted to the users under the Bill. In today’s post, we discuss the provisions under the Bill for the regulation of social media intermediaries.
</p>
<h3>The Issue: Voluntary Verification of Users of Social Media Intermediaries</h3>
<p>The Bill creates a new category of data fiduciary called ‘social media intermediaries’. <a href=""https://www.prsindia.org/sites/default/files/bill_files/Personal%20Data%20Protection%20Bill%2C%202019.pdf"">Clause 26</a> of the Bill defines a social media intermediary as an intermediary whose primary function is to enable online interaction between two or more users and allow them to create, upload, share, disseminate, modify or access information using its services. Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. fall under this category. These social media intermediaries may be further classified as significant data fiduciaries, if their user base surpasses the prescribed threshold, or their actions have, or are likely to have a significant impact on electoral democracy, security of the State, public order or the sovereignty and integrity of India. The provision further empowers the Central Government to notify these thresholds.
</p>
<p>The classification of social media intermediaries into significant data fiduciaries entails increased obligations for such social media intermediaries. These obligations include conducting data impact assessments, auditing of personal data by an independent data auditor, maintenance of records, and appointing a data protection officer. While these obligations are important for the protection of personal data of the users, what is concerning is the obligation of social media intermediaries (which are notified as a significant data fiduciary) under <a href=""https://www.prsindia.org/sites/default/files/bill_files/Personal%20Data%20Protection%20Bill%2C%202019.pdf"">Clause 28</a> that requires them to enable voluntary identification of the users. As per the provision, users who voluntarily verify their accounts have to be provided with some demonstrable and visible marks of verification.
</p>
<p>The issue with these provisions is that they have little to do with a data protection regime. The classification of social media intermediaries into significant social media intermediaries is based on vague and broad factors, like significant impact on electoral democracy, security of the State, etc. These vague grounds confer ample discretion to the government for this classification. Furthermore, such classification is not on the basis of their data collection and processing practices, or the potential privacy risks that would ensue. More importantly, the collection of identity documents of users by social media companies for verification of user accounts will lead to further data collection by these companies, and it is in <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/here-comes-the-bill-all-dressed-in-nil/"">stark contrast to the principle of data minimisation</a>. A provision for voluntary verification of users is not found in any other data protection laws in the world. As our identity documents are our sensitive personal data, we should prevent these social media giants from getting a hold of it.
</p>
<h3>The Concerns: Surveillance and Profiling of users</h3>
<p>The new category of data fiduciaries (social media intermediaries), and the provision for voluntary verification of users of social media were absent in the 2018 draft of the Bill, as well as in the report (<a href=""https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Data_Protection_Committee_Report.pdf"">Free and Fair Digital Economy: Protecting Privacy, Empowering India</a>) of the Committee of Experts on a Data Protection Framework for India (Chair: Justice B. N. Srikrishna). Therefore, the objectives behind these provisions are not clear. We believe that these provisions have been included in the Bill with the aim to counter fake news and disinformation. Even if this is the intention behind the inclusion of these provisions, it is still not clear how voluntary verification of user accounts helps in curbing fake news and disinformation. For example, <a href=""https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-05-16/india-covid-19-cow-dung-fake-remedies-alternative-medicine/100132838"">several sitting legislators have tweeted out scientifically inaccurate information</a> about alternative treatments for COVID-19, in spite of the Indian Medical Association pointing out the risks associated with such treatments.
</p>
<p>On the contrary, voluntary verification of user accounts can lead to profiling and targeting of users by social media intermediaries. It is no secret that social media companies thrive by capitalising on our personal data. Provisions like clause 28 enable social media companies to gain greater access to our official identifiers, which can in turn be used to engage in more <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/here-comes-the-bill-all-dressed-in-nil/"">advanced targeting and surveillance</a>. The more data these companies have about us, the greater is their power over us. Giving our sensitive personal data to social media giants like Facebook comes with the risks of data breaches. We all know how frequently these social media companies face data breaches, most recent being the <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/breach-please-why-companies-like-fb-need-to-be-held-accountable-by-cert-in/"">data breach at Facebook</a> which exposed the personal data of over 53 crore users. Now imagine if this personal data had included our official identifiers. That would have been deeply troubling indeed!
</p>
<p>Again, verification of social media accounts, means your ability to stay anonymous online is restricted. While some may argue that anonymity fuels disinformation, online abuse, etc., we cannot ignore the fact that anonymity also creates that safe space for everyone to express and share their ideas without fear. The verification of social media accounts will stoke self-censorship and will deprive whistleblowers, dissidents, victims of sexual assaults, etc, who often resort to anonymous identities on social media websites, the opportunity to share their experiences. Anonymity is a facet of the right to informational privacy. The importance of anonymity in informational privacy, particularly in this digital age, has been recognised by the Supreme Court of Canada in its landmark decision of R v. Spencer, wherein it was held that “<a href=""https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/14233/index.do"">anonymous internet activities engage a high level of informational privacy</a>”. Therefore, any measure that impedes online anonymity will have a negative impact on the informational privacy of users.
</p>
<p>Clause 28 of the Bill makes it easy for social media companies to demand government issued identity documents like Aadhaar which contain sensitive personal data like biometric data etc. Though the clause states that such verification process is only voluntary, due to the immense power these social media companies wield, they can restrict some of their services to the users for want of verification of their account, and this can eventually lead to the mandatory verification of accounts. This could potentially shut out thousands of users from social media platforms, depriving citizens of a key stage for expressing their constitutionally guaranteed freedom of expression.
</p>
<h3>Solution - Special laws for social media intermediaries</h3>
<p>The classification of social media intermediaries into significant data fiduciaries is based on vague and broad grounds. Besides the vagueness of these grounds, they are also not connected to the objectives sought to be achieved by a data protection regime. Any measures for the regulation of social media intermediaries that are not in connection with data protection have to be through special laws for regulating the same.
</p>
<p>The concerns raised by social media intermediaries other than the protection of personal data may be addressed under the realm of<a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf""> electoral laws, intermediary liability and competition laws</a>. The new Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 is a step in this direction. The Rules require the significant social media Intermediaries to enable their users to “voluntarily'' verify their accounts, using any appropriate mechanisms. However, these Rules are also fraught with the same issues that we have discussed above. Indeed, this has already taken place, as the Rules specify a threshold of fifty lakh (5 million) registered users for social media intermediaries to be considered and regulated as a “significant social media intermediary”. We have <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/tag/itrules/"">written vociferously against the Rules</a>, asking for their withdrawal.
</p>
<p>It is thus clear that voluntary verification of user accounts will adversely affect the informational privacy of the users, while Clause 26 is not in consonance with the objectives of a data protection regime. Hence, we recommend that these provisions be deleted from the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019.

13478,"#DataProtectionTop10: Data Localisation",dataprotectiontop10-data-localisation,,,admin,2021-05-21,,Yes,live,"Fathima V N","<h3>A Threat to the Free and Open Internet</h3><h3>Tl;dr</h3>
<p>In part 6 of the #DataProtectionTop10 series, we look at the issues with the restrictions on the transfer of personal data outside India that have been imposed under the Bill. India’s data localisation policy confers excessive discretion to the government, and adversely affects the privacy of individuals. We recommend that the Bill explicitly define critical personal data and should not impose undue restrictions that affect the open nature of the internet.
</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Last time in <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectiontop10-voluntary-social-media-verification/"">part 5</a>, we discussed how voluntary verification of social media accounts affects the rights to privacy of users and leads to self-censorship. In today’s post, we examine one of the most debated issues with the Bill; India’s data localisation policy.
</p>
<p>The architecture of the internet is such that it is borderless. It allows the free flow of ideas across borders. In this globalised world, where trade is largely digitised, free flow of data has also become important for the free flow of services. Data localisation policies run contrary to the free and open nature of the internet as it curbs the free flow of data by requiring the storage and processing of personal data within national boundaries. It appears that the main policy considerations behind the data localisation policy are to e<a href=""https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Data_Protection_Committee_Report.pdf"">nsure effective enforcement, prevent foreign surveillance, avoid vulnerabilities in our fibre optic cable network system, and promote growth in the Indian digital economy</a>.
</p>
<p>Data localisation is not an entirely new concept in India. India has implemented sectoral data localisation policies before. For example, in 2018, the RBI issued a <a href=""https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11244"">Circular on the Storage of Payment System Data</a> which mandates the storage of entire data related to payment systems in systems located only in India. The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 introduces a comprehensive policy for data localisation. India’s data localisation policy is mired in a host of issues and this post intends to discuss them.
</p>
<h3>The Issue: Lack of clarity on critical personal data</h3>
<p>The restrictions on the transfer of personal data outside India is found in Chapter VII of the Bill. The restrictions are on the transfer of two categories of personal data: sensitive personal data and critical personal data. Clause 33 states that sensitive personal data can be transferred outside India after obtaining the explicit consent of the data principals, but a copy of such sensitive personal data shall continue to be stored in India. This requirement is not exactly data localisation. This is mirroring of data, as processing of sensitive personal data outside India is permitted, the only restriction is that a copy of it has to be stored in India.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Bill envisages strict data localisation for critical personal data. This means that the data classified as critical personal data can be stored and processed only in India. The transfer of critical personal data may be permitted in two situations where: the transfer is necessary for prompt actions, or the transfer, in the opinion of the Central Government, does not prejudicially affect the security and strategic interest of the State (<a href=""https://www.prsindia.org/sites/default/files/bill_files/Personal%20Data%20Protection%20Bill%2C%202019.pdf#page=22"">Clause 34</a>).
</p>
<p>The issue here is that ‘critical personal data’ is not defined under the Bill, and it is the Central Government who will decide what will fall under this category. The Report of the Committee of Experts under the Chairmanship of Justice B.N. Srikrishna (‘<a href=""https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Data_Protection_Committee_Report.pdf"">A Free and Fair Digital Economy Protecting Privacy, Empowering Indians</a>’) gives us some indication of what could potentially fall under the category of critical data. The report states that critical data will include all kinds of data necessary to keep the wheels of the economy and the nation-state turning. The report further states that it is a wider category and may include health, government services, infrastructure data and system control software which includes inter alia transport, waterways and all controlled and sensor mapped infrastructure. It is evident from these examples that critical personal data may even go beyond the scope of personal data. Given the ambiguity in the concept of critical personal data, leaving the Central Government with the power to determine what data will constitute critical personal data will certainly lead to abuse of power by the State through excessive and overbroad intrusions into privacy in the name of national security.
</p>
<h3>The Concern: Stifling innovation and threat to privacy</h3>
<p>Data localisation can stifle innovation and the free flow of data across borders. For companies from outside India, data localisation policy would mean that if they are collecting sensitive personal data of Indians, they have to have a data server located in India to store this data, or if the data they collect includes critical personal data then they will have to store and process it solely in India. Not every data fiduciary has the resources like Google and Facebook to set up servers in India. This added compliance cost would disincentivize foreign companies from bringing their services and products to India. For Indian companies, this policy would mean that their ability to avail the services of foreign cloud service providers would be restricted. Start-ups and other entities who depend on foreign cloud service providers would be required to either set up their own servers or avail the services of domestic cloud service providers. Innovation will be stifled as these businesses would be deprived of global technological developments.
</p>
<p>One of the main reasons given for data localisation is the prevention of foreign surveillance. Ironically, storing data within the State raises concerns of domestic surveillance, especially since clause 35 allows the Central government to exempt any governmental agency from the provisions of the Act. Law enforcement agencies always find it difficult to access data stored in servers that are located in other countries. With this new policy for storage of data, law enforcement agencies in the country will easily obtain greater access to data. Therefore, data localisation policy is considered very important for the effective enforcement of domestic laws. However, in the absence of strong surveillance reforms in the country, storing sensitive and critical personal data in India only raises concerns of <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf"">unbridled intrusion into privacy by the State</a>.
</p>
<p>From the perspective of data security also, data localisation is not very convincing. In fact, data localisation only creates greater risks to the security of data. Storing all critical personal data and sensitive personal data in few data centres within the country, as opposed to scattering them across the world, would only <a href=""https://script-ed.org/article/data-localisation-and-the-balkanisation-of-the-internet/"">increase the risk of cyber attacks</a>. Just like putting all our eggs in one basket!
</p>
<h3>Solution: Define critical personal data to preserve the open nature of the internet</h3>
<p>The policy for local storage of the data under the Bill is vulnerable to abuse by the State due to the ambiguity in the concept of critical personal data and the excessive discretion given to the government in determining what constitutes critical personal data. Therefore critical personal data must be defined in the Bill itself and should not be left to be defined by the executive <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf"">without any guiding principles</a>. It is also important that data which pertains to the critical information infrastructure of the State and that does not fall under personal data be kept out of the purview of critical personal data.
</p>
<p>The seventh principle of the <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/principles"">Indian Privacy Code</a> which is concerned with the protection of the open internet states that care and caution should be taken to preserve the global character of the open internet. Open internet is beneficial to Indians as they can access information, knowledge and services from all over the world. Hence, in a strong data protection law, rules such as blanket data localisation proposals, which would threaten and undermine the global open internet should not be included.
</p>
<p>To preserve the open nature of the internet, it is imperative that the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf"">does not mandate the storing and processing of personal data only in India</a>. The safety of personal data does not depend on the physical location where it is stored. The protection of personal data transferred outside the boundaries of India must be achieved through a data protection framework that provides for<a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf""> adequate safeguards to ensure that data protection rights</a> apply to the data of Indians no matter where it is stored and processed. For instance, Japan amended their data protection law, The Act on the Protection of Personal Information, 2003, last year to strengthen the protection of personal data in international transfers. The <a href=""https://www.ppc.go.jp/files/pdf/20200612_comparative_table_amended_APPI.pdf"">Amendment</a> will come into force in 2022 and has broadened the disclosure obligations of the data fiduciaries. It requires them to provide the users, prior to obtaining their consent, information on the data protection system of the foreign country and the actions taken by the third party for the protection of the data. The obligations of data fiduciaries have also been tightened for transfers of personal data pursuant to standard contractual clauses.
</p>
<p>Our data protection law should also consider incorporating such protections instead of a data localisation requirement. India should abandon the data sovereignty approach and should adopt approaches that ensure the free flow of data and protection of the rights of users.

This blanket exemption without any sound oversight and review mechanism raises concerns of abuse of power by the State. Hence, we recommend that a chapter on surveillance reforms be inserted in the Bill.</p><p><br /></p><h3>Background</h3>
<p>Last week we discussed how voluntary verification of social media accounts leads to data maximisation, and is a threat to informational privacy of users (<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectiontop10-voluntary-social-media-verification/"">Part 5</a>) and how local storage of the data creates roadblocks to the free flow of data and debilitates the open nature of the internet (<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectionttop10-data-localisation-a-threat-to-free-and-open-internet/"">Part 6</a>). In today’s post, we unpack the most debated issue with the will: the exemptions granted to the State for surveillance. 
</p><p>Security of the State and law enforcement have historically been a grey area and a stranglehold of the State, which it uses as a shield for surveilling its people. For example, India got its own monitoring program; the Central Monitoring System after the 26/11 Mumbai terrorist attacks, <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/watch-the-watchmen-series-part-2-the-centralised-monitoring-system/"">since a need was felt for greater coordination between law enforcement and security agencies</a> in order to protect the security of the country. Currently, India has a host of surveillance programs, both in operation as well as in the pipeline, like the <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/watch-the-watchmen-series-part-2-the-centralised-monitoring-system/"">Centralised Monitoring System (CMS)</a>, <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/watch-the-watchmen-part-1-the-national-intelligence-grid/"">The National Intelligence Grid (NATGRID)</a>, <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/watch-the-watchmen-part-3/"">Crime and Criminal Tracking Network System (CCTNS)</a>, <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/watch-the-watchmen-series-part-4-the-national-automated-facial-recognition-system/"">National Automated Facial Recognition System (NAFRS</a>) etc. What is most striking is that there are no comprehensive or robust surveillance laws in the country to effectively check the working of these projects. All we have are a <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/watch-the-watchmen-series-part-2-the-centralised-monitoring-system/"">few provisions</a> under the The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000, and the Rules made under these statutes.
</p>
<p>Section 5 sub-section 2 of The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 deals with interception of communications. In times of public emergency or in the interest of public safety the government may order for the interception of communications such as your phone calls if it is satisfied that it is ‘necessary or expedient’ to do so in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State etc. A similar (probably broader) provision for interception, decryption and monitoring of our activities on the internet is contained in section 69 of the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000. Section 69B of the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000, on the other hand, deals with surveillance of traffic data such as the IP addresses, location, the time, date and duration of communications etc. These provisions are supplemented by the Rules: <a href=""https://dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/march2007.pdf"">Rule 419A of Indian Telegraph (Amendment) Rules, 2007</a> and the <a href=""https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Information%20Technology%20%28Procedure%20and%20Safeguards%20for%20Interception%2C%20Monitoring%20and%20Decryption%20of%20Information%29%20Rules%2C%202009.pdf"">Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Interception, Monitoring and Decryption of Information) Rules, 2009</a>, and <a href=""https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Information%20Technology%20%28Procedure%20and%20Safeguards%20for%20Interception%2C%20Monitoring%20and%20Decryption%20of%20Information%29%20Rules%2C%202009.pdf"">Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Monitoring and Collecting Traffic Data or Information) Rules, 2009</a>. In addition to these sections and the Rules framed thereunder, the license agreements between the Department of Telecommunications and telecom service providers require telecom service providers to assist the government in conducting surveillance.
</p><p><br /></p><h3>Issues: Overbroad exemptions and no safeguards</h3>
<p>The main issues with these provisions are that a) they do not provide for an oversight mechanism for surveillance and b) that there is no review of the order for surveillance. The orders are issued by the executive and oversight of the implementation of these orders, if any, is also by the executive. The current laws on surveillance in India are fraught with several legal and procedural infirmities and pave the path to the rise of a surveillance State. It is thus imperative for us to examine whether the Personal Data Protection Bill ameliorates the concerns around the existing regime for surveillance.
</p>
<p>When the new draft of the Bill came in 2019, everyone wanted to see what the fate of the section on exemptions that granted the State significant discretionary power to exempt its agencies from any provisions of the Bill would be. It was however quite shocking to see that the Bill confers more power than ever to the State for surveillance.
</p>
<p>The power of the Central Government to conduct surveillance is contained in clause 35 of the Bill. Clause 35 enables the Central Government to exempt by order any agency of the government from all or any provisions of the Bill. The order under clause 35 is passed in the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, or to prevent incitement to the commission of an offence. The only safeguard given here again is that the order should be in writing and it should contain the reasons for the exemption.
</p>
<p>The issues with clause 35 are very patent. The provision is very vague and broad to grant the State unfettered access to personal data without adequate safeguards. The Bill replaces the established principles of ‘necessity and proportionality’ with ‘necessity or expediency’, which allows the leeway to enact lower standards of protection. The State can exempt any of its agencies by passing an executive order and these orders are not subject to any review. Moreover, it is left to the State to prescribe the procedure, safeguards and oversight mechanism to be followed by the agency exempted from the Bill. This provision is a flagrant violation of the natural principle of justice- ‘no one shall be a judge in his own cause’.
</p>
<p>The power of the State to exempt any agency of the State on very flexible grounds such as public order, or prevention of incitement to the commission of an offence by a mere executive order further increases the power of the State to surveil us. This dangerous provision can actualize our fears of the State turning into an ‘<a href=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/personal-data-protection-bill-can-turn-india-into-orwellian-state-justice-bn-srikrishna/articleshow/72483355.cms?from=mdr"">Orwellian State</a>’. For instance, we have previously explained the possibilities of abuse of this provision in our <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/104V9yn1ygjHjIdK92ZWz7P-oNvbjSrzY/view"">public brief</a> on the impact of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 on the National Population Register (NPR). NPR was originally intended as a solution to the problem of infiltration at the national borders, and therefore nothing prevents the Central Government from invoking the grounds of security of the State to exempt NPR from the provisions of the Bill.
</p>
<p>Clause 36 is another exemption available to the State. Law enforcement agencies are exempted from the provisions of the Bill except the obligation to process the data fairly and reasonably and to maintain security safeguards in processing the data, for law enforcement purposes such as prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of any offence or any other contravention of any law. Here again, the Bill has failed to mandate that the exemption should be granted only when it is necessary and proportionate for the purposes of law enforcement.
</p><p><br /></p><h3>Clause 35 vis-a-vis the Sri Krishna Committee Report</h3>
<p>Clause 35 does not incorporate the recommendations of the Report of the Committee of Experts under the Chairmanship of Justice B.N. Srikrishna (‘<a href=""https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Data_Protection_Committee_Report.pdf"">A Free and Fair Digital Economy Protecting Privacy, Empowering Indians</a>’), and is also a stark deviation from the 2018 draft of the Bill. The report warns that ‘the pillars of a data protection law should not be shaken by a vague and nebulous national security exemption’. However, it is unfortunate to note that the Bill does exactly what was feared by the Committee.
</p>
<p>The report makes several incredible recommendations regarding surveillance provisions for a future data protection law:
</p>
<p>The report discusses only one ground for exemptions; security of the State, as opposed to the five grounds given under clause 35. The report is emphatic that the exemptions to State should strictly adhere to the judgement of the Supreme Court of India in Justice K S Puttaswamy v. Union of India and Anr.
</p>
<p>Any exemption from the data protection law must be ‘necessary and proportionate’ in the interest of the security of the State and such exemption should be pursuant to a law that meets the constitutionality test. Since exemptions involve the infringement of privacy of the individuals, the report mandates that the restrictions on privacy should be proportionate and narrowly tailored to the stated objectives.
</p>
<p>The report does not envisage a blanket exemption to the State. The agencies of the State are not exempted from the obligation to maintain security safeguards in processing personal data.
</p>
<p>The report also addresses the issue of lack of oversight of intelligence gathering and recommends that the Central Government should bring in a law to this effect. The report states that there should be ex-ante access control as well as ex-post accountability. Therefore, the law should provide for both parliamentary oversight as well as judicial approval of all requests for non-consensual access to personal data. Further, the surveillance laws should provide for measures to assess the extent of risks of a proposed measure to the privacy of the individual.
</p><p><br /></p><h3>Solution: a New Chapter on Surveillance Reforms</h3>
<p>As the <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/principles"">fifth principle</a> of the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 notes a complete code on data protection comes with strong surveillance reforms. Any data protection framework has to restrict mass or dragnet surveillance as it contravenes the principles of necessity, proportionality and purpose limitation. Procedural safeguards have to be in place even for individual surveillance and interception. Interception of communications has to be through an order passed by the judiciary. The principle also states that the evidence gathered illegally must be made inadmissible as evidence in legal proceedings.
</p>
<p>It is imperative that the exemptions to the State under Bill be restricted and narrowly tailored to cater to the protection of the privacy of individuals. Surveillance and interception have serious implications on the privacy of individuals, yet it is inevitable in certain circumstances. Further, the current laws do not adequately address the privacy concerns caused by surveillance and interception of communications. Therefore, the Bill should devote a separate chapter for surveillance reforms. Moreover, the agencies of the State eligible for being exempted under clause 35 must include only those agencies that are authorised by an Act of Parliament to conduct surveillance and interception. Such agencies have to be clearly identified and notified by the Central government. Further, the Bill should also provide for <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf"">procedures for such agencies to seek permission from a judicial authority</a>, preferably by special benches or tribunals consisting of retired High Court judges.
</p>
<p>One of the main lacunae in the current surveillance laws is that there is no proper institutional oversight and accountability mechanism. Therefore, we recommend that an <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf"">oversight and accountability structure</a> be made part of the proposed architecture of the Data Protection Authority. An ideal way to do this would be to add within the Data Protection Authority an office for surveillance reform and oversight. For emergency surveillance and interception of communications, <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf"">permission may be granted through judicial orders</a> and such orders must require the exempted agencies to follow the necessity and proportionality principles. Further, the enforcement and compliance mechanisms of such orders may be determined by the Data Protection Authority.
</p>
<p>Mass surveillance is an egregious form of surveillance and is unsuitable in any democratic society. Therefore, there needs to be an explicit ban on mass surveillance. Clause 35 in its current form can render the rights and protections of users under the Bill redundant, and hence the Bill needs to be reviewed to make it replete with safeguards against surveillance and plug the holes in the existing laws on surveillance in the country.

<p>Through an Order dated 25th March, 2021, the Central Information Commission (CIC) had accepted our submissions in our <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/persist-transparency-dpd-cic/"">second appeal</a> against the Ministry of Electronics &amp; Information Technology (MeitY) and directed the Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) to re-visit the original RTI application and provide us with a revised reply and the comments, if no valid exemptions could be claimed. The information we sought related to the disclosure of comments on a public consultation on the draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018. However, the CPIO simply cited the same exemption under S.8 of the RTI Act that she had provided before the CIC, despite clear directions from the CIC to revisit and revise.
</p><p><br /></p>
<h3>We just wanted to see the comments to the PDPB consultation, but had to go all the way to the CIC for it</h3>
<p>When it comes to the Personal Data Protection Bill, the drafting, vendor selection and choices made by the ""expert"" committee have been the subject of a long standing controversy, and <a href=""https://www.epw.in/engage/article/politics-indias-data-protection-ecosystem"">civil society has criticised it for lacking diversity and expertise</a>. One of the ways to overcome this criticism is through transparency. To further this, we filed an RTI application seeking more information not only on its working but the comments which were sent in response to a public consultation, and made the following requests:
</p>
<ol><li>Kindly provide the number and a list of the names of persons who received comments and feedback.
</li><li>Please provide an inspection of any and all comments and feedback and records along with file notings of the feedback process of the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill.
</li><li>Provide a copy of all comments and feedback received in electronic form on CD or by copies made available on pen drive or email.
</li></ol><p>This disclosure has strangely been resisted by MeitY, who initially denied to disclose the information without quoting any provision of the Right to Information Act, 2005 (RTI Act) to justify why such denial is legal. This stance was changed before the First Appellate Authority, where the CPIO sought refuge under Section 8(1)(i) of the RTI Act, which states that cabinet papers are exempt from disclosure. We took this case to the CIC, where IFF's Of Counsel Advocate <a href=""https://twitter.com/VrindaBhandari"">Vrinda Bhandari</a> was accompanied by CCG Litigation Fellow who is hosted at IFF, <a href=""https://twitter.com/krishnesh78"">Krishnesh Bapat</a>.
</p>
<p>Before the CIC, the CPIO submitted her Written Submissions, where she changed her stance again, and added another ground under which to seek refuge - S. 8(1)(c) of the RTI Act, which exempts from disclosure information relating to parliamentary privilege. We argued that neither S. 8(1)(i) nor 8(1)(c) of the RTI Act apply to the information we sought; that denial of access to information through any exemption under S. 8 of the RTI Act has to be justified through extensive written reasons and that the CPIO cannot simply reproduce the provision mechanically (See <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/27009576/""><em>Supreme Court of India v. Subhash Chandra Agarwal</em></a>, (2020) 5 SCC 481, para 133); and that in any event, under Section 8(2) of the RTI Act a public authority may allow access to information if the public interest in disclosure outweighs the harm to the protected interests.
</p>
<p>The CIC accepted our arguments, and held that the reply of the CPIO was grossly improper, and that the exemptions claimed under S. 8 of the RTI Act were not justified even though the onus to prove that a denial of a request was justified is on the CPIO. The CIC directed the CPIO to re-visit the RTI application and provide a revised reply to the appellant, and if she is not able to justify the exemption so claimed, then the desired information should be provided.
</p><p><br /></p>
<h3>MEITY offers the same “grossly improper” response again</h3>
<p>On 13th April, 2021, the CPIO sent their revised reply to us. Shockingly, the revised reply was substantially similar to CPIO’s written submissions before the CIC that had already been rejected by the CIC. In the table below, we have reproduced the CPIO’s revised reply and Written Submission for comparison:
</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Revised reply by CPIO dated 13.04.2021</b>
<br /></p></td><td><p><b>Written submission by CPIO before the CIC</b>
</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Total No. of the responses received: 624.
<br /></p><p>The submission made to the committee by an
</p><p>Individual/Agency/Company is meant for processing and examination by the Ministry which on later stage translated into input that became the basis of the draft bill that has been approved by the Cabinet before introduction in Parliament. Accordingly, that information is exempted from disclosure under the Section 8(1)(c) of the RTI Act, 2005 i.e. there shall be no obligation to give any citizen the information, the disclosure of which would cause a breach of privilege of Parliament or the State Legislature. Since Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 is still under consideration of the Joint Committee of Parliament, the disclosure of information related to the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 would cause a breach of privilege of Parliament and hence the information, as asked by RTI applicant, is exempted under Section 8(1)(c) of the RTI Act, 2005 and accordingly cannot be provided.
</p></td><td><p>Total No. of the responses received: 624
<br /></p><p>The submission made to the committee by an Individual/Agency/Company is confidential and meant for examination by the Ministry. The submission alluded to, will later translate into input that goes into the draft bill, that has to be approved by the Cabinet before it is introduced in Parliament. Moreover, as per the Section 8(1)(c) of the RTI Act, 2005, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen the information, the disclosure of which would cause a breach of privilege of Parliament or the State Legislature. As Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 is under consideration of the Joint Committee of Parliament, the disclosure of information related to the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 would cause a breach of privilege of Parliament and hence the information, as asked by RTI applicant, cannot be provided.
</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The CPIO has simply altered the grammar in a few spots and returned the same reply to us. No justification has been provided for why S.8(1)(c) applies to the information we are seeking, beyond what has already been rejected by the CIC. Accordingly, since no justifiable exemption has been found, the CPIO ought to have disclosed the information to us. It is also not the CPIO’s case that the information is not available with the CPIO.
</p><p><br /></p>
<h3>Our complaint to the CIC</h3>
<p>We decided to bring this gross evasion of responsibility on part of the CPIO to the notice of the CIC, by filing a complaint under Section 18(1) of the RTI Act. In our complaint, we have set out the above factual background, including the table illustrating the shocking similarity between the CPIO’s revised reply and the written submissions.
</p>
<p>We have submitted that the CPIO has <em>malafidely</em> denied information to and has wantonly disregarded the decision of the Hon’ble Commission dated 25th March, 2021, and have prayed for the following relief from the CIC:
</p>
<ol><li>Issue appropriate orders or directions against the CPIO for acting in disregard of the directions of the Hon’ble Central Information Commission dated 25.03.2021;
</li><li>Issue appropriate orders or directions against the CPIO for malafidely denying information to the Complainant; and
</li><li>Such other reliefs as the Hon’ble Commission deems fit.
</li></ol><p>In the complaint we have submitted that the CPIO was aware that the Hon’ble Commission had dismissed the justification provided in the Written Submission and yet the CPIO chose to reproduce that justification provided in the ‘revised’ reply. This shows <em>mala fide</em> on part of the CPIO wherein she has deliberately refused to provide information without any reasonable cause and with a reckless intention to obstruct disclosure of information.
</p>
<p>We have run from pillar to post to attain the information sought in the RTI application filed in October of 2018 and we have not yet received a proper justification why the information is being denied, let alone the information itself. However, we do not intend to let this matter go without a lawful conclusion.
</p>
<p>We believe that the <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/tag/dataprotectiontop10/"">Personal Data Protection Bill (PDPB)</a> is going to be a huge step in the field of your privacy. Whether this is a step forward or a step backward can only be determined through transparency and honesty on the part of MeitY. That is why it is crucial to see the extent of public participation in the drafting of PDPB, and why the MeitY must take a much more proactive approach towards disclosure of information. We will keep you updated on the progress of our complaint.

<p>In Part 8 of the #DataProtectionTop10, we analyse the provisions in the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 which relate to the Data Protection Authority of India (DPA). The independence of the Data Protection Authority of India is being called into question by certain provisions in the Bill such as clause 42, wherein the Selection Committee which selects the members of the DPA are all members of the executive and clause 86 which states that the DPA shall be bound by the orders of the Central Government. We recommend that the constitution of Selection Committee be made diverse and clause 86 be deleted from the Bill.
</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>So far, we have been discussing the issues with regard to the substantive provisions of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, such as the <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectiontop10-on-the-need-to-protect/"">rights</a>, <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectiontop10-exceptions-to-consent-a-torn-safety-net/"">consent</a>, <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectionttop10-data-localisation-a-threat-to-free-and-open-internet/"">data localisation</a> etc., and in the last post (<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectiontop10-state-security-and-surveillance/"">Part 7</a>) we discussed how the provisions in the Bill act as an enabler of surveillance by the State and the need to have a chapter on surveillance reforms in the Bill. In today’s post, we will be delving into the issues with the regulatory mechanism created under the Bill for the enforcement of these substantive provisions.
</p>
<p>The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 provides the users with certain rights and imposes certain obligations on the entities collecting and processing the data. However, a data protection regime should not end there. It should also provide for a competent enforcement mechanism to breathe life into the protections and guarantees available to the users under a data protection regime. The Bill therefore provides for the constitution of Data Protection Authorities. Having a Data Protection Authority is however not a guarantee that there would be effective enforcement of the provisions of the Bill. The strength of the regulator depends on its constitution, powers and functions. Hence, we need to examine how independent our Data Protection Authority is and what are it’s powers and functions.
</p>
<h3>Issue: Constitution of the Selection Committee and Lack of Independence of the DPA</h3>
<p>Chapter IX contains the regulatory architecture proposed in the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. The regulatory body envisaged under the Bill is the Data Protection Authority of India (DPA). The DPA is entrusted with the function of monitoring and enforcement, policy framing and standard setting, research and awareness, and inquiry and grievance handling. Further, the DPA is not a sector specific regulator, every entity that handles data falls under the jurisdiction of the DPA, irrespective of the sector to which they belong.
</p>
<p>Clause 42 deals with the constitution of the DPA. The DPA, as proposed by the Bill, shall consist of a Chairperson and not more than six whole-time Members appointed by the central government on the recommendation made by the Selection Committee. The Selection Committee in turn consists of the Cabinet Secretary, the Secretary to the Government of India in the Ministry or Department dealing with the Legal Affairs; and the Secretary to the Government of India in the Ministry or Department dealing with the Electronics and Information Technology. Evidently, the composition of the Selection Committee raises concerns as its members are all bureaucrats leaving the constitution of the DPA entirely to the discretion of the executive. This is a drastic shift from the structure of the Selection Committee that was proposed by the Report of the Committee of Experts under the Chairmanship of Justice B N Sri Krishna (‘<a href=""https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Data_Protection_Committee_Report.pdf"">A Free and Fair Digital Economy Protecting Privacy, Empowering Indians</a>’) and the <a href=""https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Personal_Data_Protection_Bill,2018.pdf"">2018 draft of the Bill</a>.
</p>
<p>The Report as well as the 2018 draft of the Bill had prescribed a Selection Committee composed of the Chief Justice of India (CJI) or another Judge of the Supreme Court, the Cabinet Secretary and a subject-matter expert appointed by the CJI and the Cabinet Secretary. Thus, it was a mix of executive, judicial, and external expertise. This diversity is essential for ensuring the accountability of the DPA and for preventing the DPA from becoming an extended arm of the executive. It is very important that the selection of members to the DPA happen in a fair and transparent manner as the government agencies are to be regulated as data fiduciaries under the Bill - a DPA that is subordinate to the government would allow the latter to ride roughshod over privacy concerns without any measure of accountability.
</p>
<p>The most egregious drawback of the PDP Bill 2019, is perhaps manifested in Clause 86, where the Central Government is empowered to issue directions to the DPA. The result being that the DPA will be tethered down by this power of the government. This will significantly encroach on the independence of the DPA to function in a capacity that ensures it is free from undue governmental interference. A blanket provision such as Clause 86, will be detrimental to achieving the goal of a truly independent data protection regulator. This is especially important given the significant exemptions provided to government agencies.
</p>
<p>Another concern regarding the constitution of the DPA is the <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf"">lack of decentralisation of the DPA</a>. The data principals contemplated under the Bill cover almost everyone and hence the number of anticipated data protection grievances are also expected to be huge. This will require the constitution of DPAs at State levels. However, the Bill envisages the creation of a regulator like the RBI or SEBI which are centralised regulators. Access to enforcement mechanisms is must for the effective realisation of the rights of users under the Bill.
</p>
<p>The Bill provides under Clause 62 for the appointing of Adjudication Officers for adjudging penalties and compensations under various clauses in the Bill. While this appears to be a fair provision needed for the smooth working of the data protection regime, it has been diluted by clause 62 which states that the Adjudication Officers will be appointed by the DPA. Furthermore, clause 63 provides that Adjudication Officers can adjudicate enquiries initiated only on the complaints made by the DPA. Such provisions would inevitably affect the independence of Adjudicating Officers, and so <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf"">there is a need to separate the adjudication wing from the investigation wing.</a> Since the DPA, as we have seen above, is heavily under the control of the executive, bringing another office under the DPA would essentially affect the independence and working of the data protection enforcement mechanism.
</p>
<h3>Solution: Strong and Independent Regulatory Body</h3>
<p>An independent data protection authority is one of the core principles of data protection. In the European Union (EU),<a href=""https://gdpr-info.eu/art-52-gdpr/#:~:text=Each%20supervisory%20authority%20shall%20act,in%20accordance%20with%20this%20Regulation."">Article 52</a> of the GDPR contains specific provisions to ensure the independence of the members of the supervisory authorities and mandates that all DPAs in the EU act with “complete independence” when carrying out their duties. Furthermore, the European Court of Justice has also emphasised on the importance of an independent Data Protection Authority in a robust data protection framework. For instance, in <a href=""https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A62007CJ0518""><em>European Commission</em> v. <em>Germany</em></a>, the European Court of Justice interpreted the term ‘complete independence’ of DPAs to mean ‘a decision-making power independent of any direct or indirect external influence on the supervisory authority’.
</p>
<p>As we state in the <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/principles"">third principle</a> of the Indian Privacy Code, a strong and independent regulator for data protection is crucial to ensure that the data protection rights are put into practice and enforced. The first and most important step towards ensuring the independence of the DPA is changing the composition of the Selection Committee. The composition of the Selection Committee must be made diverse as was proposed in the 2018 draft of the Bill. Therefore, it <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf"">must comprise of a judicial authority, an executive authority and external members</a>. To ensure transparency in the process for appointment of the DPA Chairperson and Members, the process must include <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/essential-features-of-a-rights-respecting-data-protection-law/"">an open call for applications</a>. Further, to bring transparency to the working of the Committee, <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf"">the proceedings of the Committee must be a matter of public record</a>. The subject matter of regulation: personal data is something in which both the State and private players have vested interests. Therefore, to ensure the independence of the DPA it is essential to keep persons with vested or political interests out of the DPA. Along with ensuring independence of the DPA it is equally important to put some measures in place to make the DPA accountable to the public.
</p>
<p>DPA’s jurisdiction is very wide and it cuts across all the sectors. Hence, in order to make the DPA more accessible and avoid pendency, it is important that <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/essential-features-of-a-rights-respecting-data-protection-law/"">DPAs are set up at state and regional levels.</a> Adjudicating Officers are an important constituent of the regulatory architecture under the Bill. Therefore, the Bill should provide for a transparent process for the appointment of the Adjudicating Officers. The appointment has to be done by <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf"">independent bodies designed to select judicial officers</a>. The power of the Central Government to give directions to the DPA will significantly dilute its independence. Hence, we recommend that clause 86 be deleted from the Bill. The provisions in the data protection law should be geared towards establishing the regulatory legitimacy of the DPA.

<p>In Part 9 of the #DataProtectionTop10, we analyse some miscellaneous provisions in the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 that require revision. Firstly, the Bill does not expressly acknowledge a natural person as the owner of their data. Secondly, the Bill does not have any provisions that give the data fiduciaries time to make a smooth transition into the new regime. Thirdly, the Bill has been given an overriding effect over other laws including the Right to Information Act, 2005. This provision may ultimately lead to undermining the RTI Act by stifling transparency. We, therefore, recommend that the Bill must acknowledge a natural person as the owner of her data, provide sound provisions for facilitating the transition to the new regime and give the RTI Act precedence over the Bill in case of inconsistency.
</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>We are just a post away from the finale of this series. Last week we looked at two very important issues with the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 such as the overbroad exemptions granted to the State for engaging in surveillance (<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectiontop10-state-security-and-surveillance/"">Part 7</a>) and the provisions that affect the independence and accountability of the Data Protection Authority (<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectiontop10-on-the-importance-of-a-strong-and-independent-data-protection-authority/"">Part 8</a>). In today’s post, we discuss some of the issues with the Bill that, though, are not widely discussed, have very serious implications on the effectiveness of the Bill. 
</p>
<p>The Bill is silent on who is the owner of the personal data. And, this can naturally lead to a doubt whether the owner of the personal data is you (from whom this data originates), or is it the data fiduciaries (who collect, store and process your personal data). This post will discuss whether the Bill clears this doubt. This post will also look into the ramifications of giving the Bill an overriding effect over other laws in force, and whether the Bill facilitates the transition into the new data protection regime.
</p>
<h3>Issues</h3>
<p>Undoubtedly, it is the natural persons or the users to whom the data pertains who should be the owners of their data. While the Bill grants certain rights and protections to the users, it does not expressly declare that natural persons are the owners of their personal data. Some data protection laws around the world give emphasis to the right of ownership of a natural person over their personal data, one such example is the <a href=""https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/Brazilian_General_Data_Protection_Law.pdf"">General Data Protection Law, 2018</a> of Brazil which states in explicit terms that ""every natural person is assured ownership of her/his personal data"". The Bill has unfortunately failed to cement the foundation of our data protection law by not reiterating that natural persons are the rightful owners of their personal data.
</p>
<p>It is very odd to notice that the Bill does not provide for any transition provision that would help the businesses in making a smooth transition to the new data protection regime. The Bill proposes to introduce a regime that is entirely new to the data fiduciaries and entails drastic changes to their existing data management practices. The data fiduciaries will be undergoing significant organisational changes. Even from the point of view of regulation, the State will have to augment its regulatory capacity by setting up an entirely new regulatory infrastructure for the enforcement of the Bill. This will require some time. It was for these reasons that the Report of the Committee of Experts under the Chairmanship of Justice B N Sri Krishna (‘<a href=""https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Data_Protection_Committee_Report.pdf"">A Free and Fair Digital Economy Protecting Privacy, Empowering Indian</a>s’) recommended the inclusion of provisions for facilitating a seamless transition to the new data protection regime in the <a href=""https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Personal_Data_Protection_Bill,2018.pdf"">2018 draft of the Bill</a>.
</p>
<p>The GDPR has been mindful of the need for facilitating such transition. GDPR came into force in the European Union (EU) after repealing its previous data protection regime: Directive 95/46/EC popularly known as the Data Protection Directive. <a href=""https://gdpr-text.com/read/recital-171/"">Recital 171</a> of the GDPR states that ‘processing that is already underway on the date of application of the GDPR should be brought into conformity with GDPR within the period of two years after which the Regulation enters into force’. So, for a company that has been collecting and processing data as per the Data Protection Directive, a period of two years was given from the date on which the GDPR was entered into force to come in conformity with the GDPR. Furthermore, if the data was processed under the Data Protection Directive based on the consent of the users, then no further consent is required to be obtained under the GDPR if the manner in which consent was obtained under the Directive is in conformity with the consent standards under the GDPR: i.e. the consent is freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous.
</p>
<p>Additionally, clause 96 confers an overriding effect to the Bill. This essentially means that whenever there is a conflict between the provisions of the Bill and any other laws, the provisions of the Bill will prevail. While this is essential to give the new data protection regime supremacy over the prevailing data protection practices, such a blanket clause affects the rights of citizens under the <a href=""https://rti.gov.in/rti-act.pdf"">Right to Information Act, 200</a>5 (RTI Act).
</p>
<p>Citizens have the right to obtain information from public authorities under Chapter II of the RTI Act. Considering the privacy implications of such disclosure of information, the RTI Act, under section 8 provides an exception to the rule of disclosure if the disclosure of the information would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of the public officials. Hence, the Act provides safeguards for balancing citizen's right to information and the right to privacy of public officials. The overriding clause under the Bill would make secrecy the rule and disclosure the exception, impeding the transparency guaranteed under the RTI Act.
</p>
<h3>Solutions:</h3>
<p>The Bill must <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf"">unequivocally acknowledge a natural person as owner of her data</a>. A provision in this regard is necessary to entrench the control and the rights natural persons have over their personal data.
</p>
<p>As stated above, a transition provision is essential for facilitating the transition into the new data protection regime. The Bill should give adequate time for the data fiduciaries to make the switch to a new data protection regime. Additionally, the Bill should make it clear that the Bill applies to the data collected prior to the coming into force of the Bill, if such data is continued to be stored and processed by the data fiduciary. For example, if a website collects your data before the data protection law comes into force and continues to retain it even after the law comes into force, the website will have to comply with the new law. Similarly, if the data collected prior to this law comes into force are inconsistent with the law, <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf"">they must be destroyed if consent is withdrawn</a>. The consent taken under the old regime will have to be obtained again, if the consent obtained was not free, informed, clear, and specific.
</p>
<p><a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/principles"">Principle 6</a> of the Indian Privacy Code acknowledges the importance of protecting and strengthening the right to information of individuals. The RTI Act, 2005 has been instrumental in ensuring accountability to the functioning of government and public authorities. Moreover, the RTI Act already provides adequate safeguards for the protection of privacy of the officials. The principle also addresses the need for safeguarding the independence of Information Commissioners under the RTI Act and hence states that the Information Commissioners must be exempted from interference or control by the data protection regulator.
</p>
<p>The Srikrishna Committee Report observes that ‘to prevent privacy from becoming a stonewalling tactic to hinder transparency’ the data protection law should not apply to disclosure under the RTI Act. Therefore, the Bill needs to provide a carve-out for the RTI Act and specifically state that provisions of the RTI Act will <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf"">have precedence over this law in case of inconsistency</a>. This is essential for protecting the existing safeguards in place for ensuring accountability and transparency in a democratic society.

<p>In Part 10 of the #DataProtectionTop10 series, we discuss the need for protection of whistleblowers, digital security researchers, and vulnerability testers. As per Clause 25 of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 only the data fiduciaries can report data breaches to the Data Protection Authority, not the whistleblowers. If clause 25 in its current form becomes the law then people will be dissuaded from whistleblowing. Further, though the Bill provides protection to researchers under Clause 38, there are no clear protections provided for skilled cyber security researchers who conduct vulnerability testing. Therefore we recommend that the Bill must make amendments to provide clear provisions detailing the procedure for security researchers, vulnerability testers and whistleblowers. Section 43 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 must also be amended to prevent vexatious legal claims and proceedings against vulnerability testers and cyber security experts.
</p>
<h3>Recap</h3>
<p>This is the last post in the #DataProtectionTop10 series. In these past 4 weeks, through 9 posts, we discussed the issues with the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019.
</p>
<p>Here is a quick recap: We started off the series by discussing the issues with the preamble of the Bill; namely, lack of clarity on the objectives of the Bill (<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectiontop10-lost-in-muddled-objectives/"">part 1</a>). Then we saw in <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectiontop10-imposters-under-the-personal-data-protection-bill/"">part 2</a> how certain provisions in the Bill (particularly the provisions for Governmental access to non-personal data and the provision for sandboxes) are a tool for giving preference to the private sector and the fiscal interests of the State over the informational privacy of the users. Next, we looked at the consent provisions under the Bill (<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectiontop10-exceptions-to-consent-a-torn-safety-net/"">part 3</a>). The provisions under the Bill that allows the processing of personal data without the consent of the users grant the State undue access to personal data and the exception given to employers has the potential to encourage workplace surveillance.
</p>
<p>In <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectiontop10-on-the-need-to-protect/"">part 4</a>, we analysed the issues with the rights guaranteed to the users under the Bill and we found that though the Bill grants certain rights, the exercise of those rights have been made difficult, and hence there is a need to strengthen the rights of users. In <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectiontop10-voluntary-social-media-verification/"">part 5</a>, we looked at the issue of voluntary verification of social media accounts. And saw how this ‘voluntary verification’ may lead to a mandatory verification situation as well as advanced targeting and profiling of users.
</p>
<p>In <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectionttop10-data-localisation-a-threat-to-free-and-open-internet/"">part 6</a>, we discussed the issues with the data localisation policy of India. The Bill mandates the storage and processing of ‘critical data’ only in India, without defining what ‘critical personal data’ is. The Central Government has been given the discretion to notify critical personal data. Further, this policy also disrupts the free and open nature of the internet. Then. In <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectiontop10-state-security-and-surveillance/"">part 7</a>, we looked at a very important issue of surveillance reforms. The exemptions granted to the State from the obligations under the Bill are very wide and enable the State to conduct surveillance of the people.
</p>
<p>In <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectiontop10-on-the-importance-of-a-strong-and-independent-data-protection-authority/"">part 8</a>, we saw the issues with the regulatory architecture envisaged under the Bill: the Data Protection Authority. The various provisions under the Bill such as the constitution of the Selection Committee, Central Government’s power to issue orders to the DPA impedes the independence and accountability of the DPA. Lastly, this week in <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectiontop10-some-holes-that-need-to-be-plugged/"">part 9</a>, we discussed certain other issues with the Bill such as the lack of provisions in the Bill to facilitate transition into the new regime and the overriding effect of the Bill over the Right to Information Act, 2005.
</p>
<p>In today’s post, we discuss the ramifications of not provisioning protection to whistleblowers, digital security researchers, and vulnerability testers. India has witnessed an epidemic of data breaches in recent times, including the high profile cases of <a href=""https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/mobikwik-database-leaked-on-dark-web-company-denies-any-data-breach-7251448/"">Mobikwik</a>, <a href=""https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/mobikwik-database-leaked-on-dark-web-company-denies-any-data-breach-7251448/"">Air India</a>, and <a href=""https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/dominos-india-suffers-data-breach-details-of-18-crore-orders-on-sale-6926731.html"">Dominos</a>. The data losses in these breaches are huge, with potentially millions of users affected. The economic impact of data breaches is also tremendous. An IBM study reported that <a href=""https://www.expresscomputer.in/security/rs-14-crore-is-average-data-breach-cost-for-an-indian-firm/61463/"">the average data breach in India cost Rs 14 crore</a>, an increase of 9.4% from 2014. The per unit data cost increased by 10% to Rs 5,522. The report also noted that the average time to both detect and contain a breach went up from 221 days to 230 days and from 77 to 83 days respectively. This further indicates a significant amount of information and data loss for users. The need for improved security standards is clear, and this can only be achieved if security researchers and penetration testing is undertaken on an increased scale.
</p>
<h3>Issue</h3>
<p>Clause 25 of the Bill, relating to the Data Protection Authority (DPA), states that the users should be informed about a breach of their personal data only after the DPA considers the severity of harm, and decides if the data fiduciary should inform affected users. There are two issues with this provision: firstly, as we had discussed in Part 4, the discretion to inform the affected users is left to the DPA and that the users are not informed directly, stifling the exercise of rights of users under the Bill; secondly, the Bill casts the duty of reporting a breach of data to the DPA on the data fiduciary.
</p>
<p>The mandate under Clause 25, that only a data fiduciary can report the breaches to the DPA, creates problems for whistleblowers within a data fiduciary. Often, the users are unaware of the breach of data protection obligations by the data fiduciary particularly in relation to the breach of the limitation of purpose obligation, unauthorised sharing, or a non-notification of a security event. This information asymmetry prevents the users from enforcing their rights. Now, if any personnel working with the data fiduciary comes to know about the data breach or other breach of obligations under the data protection law, they cannot inform the users as it is for the<a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf""> data fiduciary to report such breaches and lapses to the DPA rather than whistleblowers</a>. If clause 25 in its current form becomes the law then people will be dissuaded from whistleblowing.
</p>
<p>Digital security researchers and vulnerability testers are another class of people who are important players in the cybersecurity arena. With our increased dependence on technology, data breaches have become the order of the day. We often come to know about these data breaches not from the data fiduciaries but from independent researchers. For example, the <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/mobikwik-data-breach/"">Mobikwik data breach</a> and the <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/breach-please-why-companies-like-fb-need-to-be-held-accountable-by-cert-in/"">Facebook</a> data breach that were reported recently were brought into light not by the companies themselves but by independent researchers. Given the key role played by digital security researchers and vulnerability testers in exposing data breaches, it is unfortunate to note that they are not protected under the Bill.
</p>
<p>Though the Bill provides protection to researchers under Clause 38, there <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf"">are no clear protections provided for skilled cyber security researchers</a> who conduct vulnerability testing. Even under the current laws, such persons are not protected and are often <a href=""https://thewire.in/tech/mobikwik-cybersecurity-and-a-tradition-of-going-after-the-messenger"">threatened with vexatious legal claims and proceedings</a>. Section 43 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 which penalises hacking does not make any difference between malicious hackers and ethical security researchers. Even when the researchers have acted in good faith, it is no defense under the section. Data fiduciaries exploit this leeway in the provision to press charges against cybersecurity researchers who expose data breaches in their companies. For instance, in one of our earlier <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/security-researchers-need-legislative-protection-from-vexatious-lawsuits/"">posts</a>, we have discussed how a security researcher called Dissent Doe who had exposed the data breach that happened at 1to1Help was sued before the High Court of Karnataka for the disclosure of this data. In light of this incident, we had also highlighted the need to change the National Cyber Security Policy and build legislative protections within the framework of the Personal Data Protection law.
</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>It is important to provide in the Bill protections for personnel of the respective data fiduciary who disclose the breach of obligations under the data protection law by data fiduciaries. Therefore, the Bill should include a <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf"">streamlined mechanism to encourage personnel of the respective data fiduciary to report</a> such data breaches without any fear of retaliation or retribution.
</p>
<p>Digital security researchers, and vulnerability testers play a key role in keeping the users safe and informing them about data breaches. Informing users about breaches in their data promptly is very important to <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/security-researchers-need-legislative-protection-from-vexatious-lawsuits/"">mitigate the damage caused by such data breaches and take corrective actions</a>. In addition to the direct breach notification to users we recommended in <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectiontop10-on-the-need-to-protect/"">part 4</a> of this series, the Bill must be revised to provide <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf"">clear provisions detailing the procedure</a> for security researchers, vulnerability testers, data breach reporting and whistleblowers. It is also important to amend S. 43 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 to prevent the data fiduciaries from bringing vexatious legal claims and proceedings against vulnerability testers and cyber security experts. We also recommend that the Schedule to the Bill be amended to include <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf"">narrowly tailored good faith exceptions</a> for vulnerability testers and cyber security experts.
</p>
<h3>Concluding Remarks
</h3>
<p>The decision of the Supreme Court in<em><a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/127517806/""> Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. The Union of India (2019) 1 SCC 1</a></em>, which declared right to privacy as a fundamental right and recognised informational privacy as a facet of the right to privacy, is certainly a win against the State and non-state actors who intrude into our privacy and exploit our data. However, in order for us to actually exert control on how our data is collected and used we need a strong data protection law: a data protection law that puts informational privacy of the individuals before any other considerations such as the growth of India’s digital economy. We would like to stress on one important point that data is not a commodity that should be harnessed through data protection legislation, rather it is what constitutes our identity.
</p>
<p>Our data protection law needs to be cured of the issues that we have pointed out through this series. Provisions like clause 35 severely weaken our data protection law and will not withstand the test of constitutionality. We do not want a data protection law that undermines our right to informational privacy by giving the State immense control over our data and preference to the private sector. <strong>We want a strong and user-centric data protection law that would empower the users against the exploitation of their data</strong>. A sound data protection law is the need of the hour: this is essential not only for safeguarding the informational privacy of the individuals but is also integral for other issues such as <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/watch-the-watchmen-series-part-5-the-personal-data-protection-bill-2019/"">India’s trade relations with other countries</a>.
</p>
<p>Through this series, we had hoped to draw out some of the fundamental problems with the impending Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 and suggest solutions to strengthen the law. We fervently hope that we will soon get a data protection law that upholds the key tenets of data protection. Thus, we urge the Central government to make the necessary amendments to the Bill, so as to provide users with a powerful tool against exploitative data fiduciaries, data processors, and state agencies in this data-driven world.

As a result of these breaches, data of Indian users is available to any third party over the internet for nefarious use. We have addressed a <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HpFJj2vn6_MWT3pZ-oVRdKx5sIWMqRjw/view?usp=sharing"">representation</a> dated 11th June 2021 to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (“MEITY”). In the representation, we have provided a range of recommendations to prevent and provide redressal against data breaches. We have also affixed along with the representation, a set of concrete recommendations to Air India Limited by Mr Suman Kar. Mr Kar is the founder of <a href=""https://banbreach.com/"">Banbreach</a> and has expertise in cybersecurity consulting, digital forensics and incident response.
</p>
<h3>Background
</h3>
<p>On 10th June 2021, we came across <a href=""https://twitter.com/darktracer_int/status/1402966326390394886"">reports</a> which claimed that data of 15 crores vaccinated Indians had been breached. Thankfully, cyber-security researchers subsequently <a href=""https://twitter.com/rajaharia/status/1403000365453246465"">verified</a> that the breach had not taken place. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare also <a href=""https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/health-ministry-security-researcher-deny-cowin-data-breach-affecting-150-million-indians-7016881.html"">assured</a> that the data on the CoWin portal was safe but nevertheless asked the Computer Emergency Response Team (“CERT-IN”) to investigate the issue. While we can breathe easily for now, this signals our worst fears. We do not have a robust data protection regime to respond to the rise in data breaches.
</p>
<p>A data breach exposes confidential, sensitive and protected information to unauthorised persons. As a result of data breaches, data of Indian users is available to any third party over the internet for nefarious use. The <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yc3yRISxdVx_HYI2cZ9CjjdeYhdo_8LCNgsSfM8DItw/edit"">table</a> below, which is based on publicly available information, illustrates the frequency, scale and threat posed by data breaches. <a href=""https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/data-breaches-on-the-rise-in-2021-report/article34548974.ece"">Reports</a> also indicate that data breaches affecting Indian users have been on a rise. The economic impact of data breaches is also tremendous. An IBM study reported, the <a href=""https://www.expresscomputer.in/security/rs-14-crore-is-average-data-breach-cost-for-an-indian-firm/61463/"">average data breach in India cost Rs 14 crore</a> an increase of 9.4% from 2014. The per-unit data cost increased by 10% to Rs 5,522. The report also noted that the average time to both detect and contain a breach went up from 221 days to 230 days and from 77 to 83 days respectively.
</p>
<p>Previously, we had written to CERT-IN on <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/mobikwik-data-breach/"">31st March 2021</a> and <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/breach-please-why-companies-like-fb-need-to-be-held-accountable-by-cert-in/"">8th April 2021</a> asking them to investigate data breaches affecting Indian users of MobiKwik and Facebook. However, in our opinion, CERT-IN did not respond in a robust manner and we will be following this up with further advocacy actions in the near future. We also kept coming across reports of new data breaches, including the one reported by the Government of India owned Air India Limited. Thus, we examined the legal framework and felt that there was a need to suggest substantive changes.
</p>

</h3>
<p>We have addressed a <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HpFJj2vn6_MWT3pZ-oVRdKx5sIWMqRjw/view?usp=sharing"">representation</a> dated 11th June 2021 to MEITY, CERT-IN and Air India Limited. The representation details - <strong>a) </strong>the laws data fiduciaries such as MobiKwik may have violated when data of their Indian users were breached; <strong>b)</strong> the limitations prevalent in the existing legal framework; and <strong>c) </strong>a list of recommendations to ensure that responses to data breaches are more robust.
</p>
<p>Along with the representation, we have also affixed a set of concrete recommendations by Mr Suman Kar. These recommendations are in reference to the breach reported by Air India Limited. Mr Kar is the founder of <a href=""https://banbreach.com/"">Banbreach</a> and has expertise in cybersecurity consulting, digital forensics and incident response. We are thankful to Mr Kar for advising us on the representation and for providing his recommendations.<br /></p>
<h3>Certain data breaches may be in violation of the law
</h3>
<p>The data fiduciaries who faced data breaches had a legal obligation to ensure that the personal data in their custody was safeguarded. The obligation is one of conduct and not of result - that is, a data fiduciary cannot guarantee that the data will be secure but they have to employ best practices to ensure the safety of the data. This obligation flows from the Constitution, Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act, 2000) and the common law.
</p>
<ol><li><strong>Constitution: </strong>The Hon’ble Supreme Court has recognised that informational self-determination is an aspect of the right to privacy in <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/91938676/""><em>Justice K.S Puttaswamy vs Union of India </em>(2017) 10 SCC 1</a>. Chandrachud J in his <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/127517806/"">judgement</a> in <em>Justice K.S Puttaswamy (II) vs Union of India </em>(2019) 1 SCC 1 has noted that - “<em>974…..The right to informational privacy is not only vertical (asserted and protected against state actors) but horizontal as well. Informational privacy requires legal protection because the individual cannot be left to an unregulated market place.” </em>Thus, data fiduciaries have a constitutional obligation to prevent infringement of the right to privacy.
</li><li><strong>IT Act, 2000</strong>: <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/76191164/"">Section 43A</a> of the IT Act, 2000 makes ‘body corporates’ liable for losses arising from their negligent handling of sensitive personal data. Rule 8 of the <a href=""https://www.itlaw.in/information-technology-reasonable-security-practices-and-procedures-and-sensitive-personal-data-or-information-rules-2011/"">Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data Or Information) Rules, 2011</a> (“2011 Rules”), mandates these “body corporates” to deploy ‘<em>reasonable security practices and procedures</em>’ to protect sensitive data. If data processors do not employ these practices and suffer a data breach, they have a legal obligation to provide redressal to affected users.
</li><li><strong>Common law:</strong> Common-law courts have recognised the right to claim damages for privacy violations. For instance, in <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/149860325/""><em>ABC vs Commissioner of Police and Others</em></a><em>, </em>WP(C) No. 12370 of 2005, the Delhi High Court awarded punitive damages of Rs Six (6) Lakh to a minor girl whose details had been leaked by the Commissioner of Police to media houses.
</li></ol><h3>Limitations in the existing legal framework
</h3>
<p>While the law does impose certain obligations on data fiduciaries, the redressal to users in the event of a data breach is not forthcoming. We list a few reasons why this is the case:
</p>
<ol><li><strong>No obligation to notify</strong>: There is no legal obligation on data fiduciaries to notify affected users in case a breach takes place. Communicate-Comply-Investigate is a three-step process that should be complied with for mitigating the impact of breaches. This means that data fiduciaries must inform the public when a data breach occurs. While Air India Ltd did send across a notification to its customers, MobiKwik chose not to engage at all.
</li><li><strong>Sensitive personal data is narrowly defined: </strong>Section 43A only provides compensation for negligent handling of sensitive data. According to Rule 3 of 2011 Rules, sensitive data is limited to information such as passwords, financial information, sexual orientation, medical records, and biometric information. The IT Act, 2000 does not provide any redressal if information such as name, email address, home address and passport details is breached.
</li><li><strong>Lack of investigations: </strong>When breaches take place, proper investigations are not conducted to enable users to claim compensation under Section 43A of the IT Act, 2000. For example, CERT-IN, which is the body tasked to investigate such breaches under <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/80680324/"">Section 70B</a> of the IT Act, 2000, has only issued an advisory with respect to the Facebook breach. Till date, it is unclear if Facebook has been complying with Rule 8 of the 2011 Rules. With respect to the other breaches listed above, it is unclear if CERT-IN has taken any steps.
</li><li><strong>Inadequate redressal mechanism: </strong>The redressal mechanism under Section 46 of the IT Act is inadequate. Under this provision, MEITY has appointed the Secretary of the Department of Information Technology of each state as adjudicating officers to determine if anyone has committed a violation of provisions of Chapter IX of IT Act, 2000 including Section 43A. In cases where data in the custody of the Government is breached, as is the case with the Air India breach, these adjudicating officers cannot adjudicate the dispute. This is because they are appointed by the government and thus, do not have the independence that is necessary to resolve a dispute which involves the government.
</li></ol><h3>List of recommendations
</h3>
<p>Considering the possible violation of law by data fiduciaries in whose custody data was breached and the lacunae in the existing legal regime, we have made the following recommendations in the representation:
</p>
<ol><li>Direct investigation into the conduct of data fiduciaries, including those mentioned below, that have faced data breaches in the past two years.
</li><li>Mandate data fiduciaries to notify users in case they experience a data breach.
</li><li>Ensure that the Indian Citizens who have been impacted by data breaches are provided adequate compensation.
</li><li>Undertake steps to make suitable changes in the Information Technology Act, 2000 so that a judicial officer is empowered to adjudicate disputes under Section 46.
</li><li>Hold the Government and Government-owned entities to stricter data security standards as compared to private entities.
</li><li>Increase the types of personally identifiable information mentioned in Rule 3 of the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data Or Information) Rules, 2011 considering that the current set is exceptionally narrow.
</li><li>Mandate the need to maintain ‘accountability logs’ for security measures to ensure a dynamic compliance mechanism.
</li><li>Introduce a tiered system of security compliance based on the scale and sensitivity of data involved to enforce the security of Indian networks and databases.
</li></ol><h3>Conclusion
</h3>
<p>We hope the MEITY, CERT-IN and Air India consider our recommendation. As <a href=""https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-risks-report-2021"">World Economic Forum’s <em>The Global Risks Report 2021</em></a> has stated, cybersecurity failure is one of the greatest threats facing humanity over the next decade. Thus it is imperative that we start taking steps to prevent such failures and develop mechanisms to provide redressal. We remain available to the addressees for any further assistance on these issues and encourage a wider community of security researchers to reach out to us on policy@internetfreedom.in and legal@internetfreedom.in

13485,"#PrivacyofThePeople - ASHA Workers and Employee Surveillance",privacyofthepeople-asha-workers-and-employee-surveillance,,,admin,2021-06-23,,Yes,live,"Tanvi Roy","<h3>Tl;dr</h3>
<p>In our new weekly series #PrivacyofThePeople, we will look at the impact of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 on different sections of society. In this post, we discuss the issue of worker surveillance through the ASHA workers’ recent fight for digital privacy. We also detail how the Bill affects workplace surveillance at large. Simply put, there cannot be a compromise on privacy in the name of “efficiency”. Mass surveillance disproportionately affects marginalized groups and only continues to foster mistrust amongst people.
</p>
<h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
<p>As has been <a href=""https://zeenews.india.com/technology/joint-parliamentary-committee-gets-an-extension-on-data-protection-bill-2350571.html"">reported earlier</a>, the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 is likely to submit its report in the upcoming Monsoon session of Parliament. Thus, as we inch closer to the session, it is important that we assiduously scrutinize the existing Bill. It is with this in mind that we launched our previous two series on the Bill recently. The first, <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/constitutional-utopias-of-digital-protection/"">#StartfromScratch</a>, was a more general series that provided some context to the bill, explained its provisions in detail, highlighted the key concerns with the Bill, and suggested potential alternative frameworks. In the second series, <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/tag/dataprotectiontop10/"">#DataProtectionTop10</a>, we went into the issues in greater depth, looking at the ten main concerns we had with the Bill.
</p>
<p>In this new series titled #PrivacyofThePeople, we wish to discuss people-centered concerns surrounding the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. Unlike our #DataProtectionTop10 and #StartFromScratch series, this series aims to highlight important issues related to the Bill through different lenses in society and examining how these issues will manifest in our daily lives. Here, we will discuss the direct implications the Bill may have on students, healthcare professionals, farmers, and more.
</p>
<h3><strong>The issue</strong></h3>
<p>According to <a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/privacy-concerns-asha-workers-to-shun-track-app/articleshow/83470224.cms"">recent media reports</a>, the Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers in Haryana were made to download a Mobile Device Management (MDM) application that violates their digital privacy. The application, “MDM 360 shield”, was forcefully installed on the workers’ personal phones (most do not earn enough to possess 2 separate phones) by local health department officials. In cases where they were provided with a new phone, the workers were not informed that the application had been pre-installed on the said device.
</p>
<p>The application allows senior officials to track the locations of ASHA workers and add/delete information on the handsets provided by the department.
</p>
<ol><li>The workers fear it will make them further vulnerable to greater scrutiny and harassment from officials.
</li><li>There is great concern regarding the privacy and safety of the primarily female workers as their coordinators and officials are mostly men.
</li><li>Such intrusive surveillance only hampers any possible unionization efforts.
</li></ol><p>In a <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ll2IBzwh86BDujn6l1GLC53w8_nZTPVG/view"">memorandum to CMO Dr. Randeep Singh Punia</a>, the ASHA workers requested to cease the “mandatory” installation of the app on their personal phones. Over 22,000 workers are now fighting against the intrusive app, with most deciding <a href=""https://www.newsclick.in/ASHA-workers-haryana-reject-govt-tracking-app-surveillance-fears"">to hand their phones back as a sign of protest</a>.
</p>
<p>Yet, it is not the first time that MDM apps are being used for worker surveillance. <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/archive/in/entry/swacch-bharat-tags-sanitation-workers-to-live-track-their-every-move_in_5e4c98a9c5b6b0f6bff11f9b"">HuffPost reported</a> a similar tracking system in Panchkula, Haryana. The Municipal Corporation forced sanitation workers to wear GPS-enabled “Human Efficiency” trackers strapped to their wrists. The physical wearable device had a microphone and camera so supervisors could watch and hear workers as they worked. Switching off the tracker during duty hours or straying from the GPS-monitored geo-fence would alert the system resulting in possible salary cuts. This is just another example of the growing number of such surveillance systems in recent years.
</p>
<p>As part of <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qjZfNEZjr9ohtGzMXsulzmgsrKXma-Rf/view"">IFF’s continued efforts</a> to fight against 360-degree surveillance of workers, on the 26th of April 2020, we sent a <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GbWcIYqP7fI6kzatt44TiQOJiuHbqrqx/view"">legal notice</a> to BECIL regarding its procurement of employee tracking devices. The “Personnel Tracking GPS Solution” posed a threat to the privacy of healthcare workers. Our <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/legal-notice-to-becil-for-its-tender-to-procure-employee-tracking-smartwatches-and-a-mass-surveillance-system/"">blogpost</a> on the issue can be read for more information.
</p>
<p>India has witnessed an increase in the use of biometric authentication, CCTV cameras, device monitoring, and location tracking by employers to monitor the activities of their employees. This surveillance revolution is sweeping India’s government departments, aided by private and state-owned companies who have spotted a lucrative opportunity to push largely untested and deeply invasive systems in the name of “digital innovations”.
</p>
<p>The problem is that such intrusive surveillance systems are implemented with little oversight, no worker consent, and no public conversation. These systems undermine the fundamental right to privacy guaranteed by Articles 14, 19, and 21 of the Constitution. Turning workplaces into panopticons not only encroaches on these basic rights, but also negatively impacts free speech and unionization. Furthermore, such surveillance systems are largely being used on marginalized members of the country’s workforce.
</p>
<h3><strong>The PDP Bill and Worker Surveillance</strong></h3>
<p>The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (PDP) prohibits the collection of sensitive personal data by employers for any purpose without the consent of the employee. However, Clause 13 of the Bill allows the processing of personal data which is not classified as sensitive personal data by employers without the consent of the employee for the following purposes:
</p>
<ul><li>recruitment or termination of employment
</li><li>provision of any service or benefit to the employee
</li><li>verification of attendance
</li><li>any other activity relating to the assessment of the performance of the employee
</li></ul><p>Furthermore, trade union affiliation has not been explicitly recognized as sensitive personal data. This can negatively impact the ability of workers to unionize which is a fundamental right guaranteed by Article 19(1)(c) of the Constitution. It is integral to protect the workers’ collective voice in any workplace as unionization can help secure worker demands.
</p>

The GDPR explicitly states that consent to giving data must be “<em>freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous</em>”. With the increased involvement of technology in mass surveillance systems, India’s PDP Bill needs to do more to safeguard the privacy, dignity, and autonomy of workers.
</p>
<p>For further analysis on the issue, we encourage you to read <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qjZfNEZjr9ohtGzMXsulzmgsrKXma-Rf/view"">our public brief on the impact of the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 on workplace surveillance</a>.
</p>
<h3><strong>Solution</strong></h3>
<p>There cannot be a compromise on data and digital privacy of employees in the name of “efficiency”. Mass surveillance disproportionately affects marginalized groups and only continues to foster mistrust. One solution is imposing a mandatory obligation on the employer to consult employees and seek their views prior to processing personal data under Clause 13, PDP Bill, 2019. The broader conversation of implementing surveillance systems must be discussed with all stakeholders including respective workers and the public at large.
</p>
<ol><li>The principles of necessity and proportionality in data processing should be included under Clause 13, PDP Bill 2019.
</li><li>A mandatory obligation should be imposed on the employer to consult employees and seek their views prior to processing personal data under Clause 13, PDP Bill, 2019.
</li><li>The Data Protection Authority should be entrusted with the responsibility of issuing a Code of Practice for workplace surveillance under Clause 50, PDP Bill, 2019.
</li><li>The Code of Practice for workplace surveillance issued by the Data Protection Authority should impose a prohibition on monitoring of any unionization-related activity and prescribe penalties for the same.
</li><li>Trade Union affiliation should be categorized as sensitive personal data under Clause 3(36), PDP Bill, 2019.

<p>In the second post in our #PrivacyOfThePeople series, we discuss the issue of farmer rights under the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 with respect to aggressive digitization by governmental initiatives. We specifically examine this through the recent Consultation Paper on IDEA by the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation, and Family Welfare. Who really benefits from Agristack systems and how does a loss of privacy affect farmers?
</p>
<h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
<p>Last week, in the <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/privacyofthepeople-asha-workers-and-employee-surveillance/"">first post</a> in our new #PrivacyOfThePeople series, we used recent protests by ASHA workers to look at larger issues with worker surveillance under the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. The growing number of intrusive systems only undermine the fundamental right to privacy, and negatively impact free speech and worker unionization. Privacy cannot be compromised in the name of “efficiency”.
</p>
<p>This series continues to discuss the very concrete problems that different groups will face after the implementation of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, and so, for this week, we decided to look at an issue that is generating a lot of discussion at present: the rights of the farmers of India. Our engagement with agriculture in India has taken place mostly through the Agristack, a proposed project for implementing digital agriculture systems across India (to better understand what the Agristack really is, please see our <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/the-agristack-a-primer/"">public explainer on the issue</a>). We have <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/joint-letter-to-the-agriculture-minister/"">written a joint letter</a> with 55 other organizations to the Ministry of Agriculture highlighting our concerns with the project. We have also analyzed the various MoUs signed by the Ministry regarding a pilot for the Agristack (see <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/revealed-ministry-of-agricultures-mou-with-microsoft-on-the-agristack-urgent-need-for-transparency-and-consultation/"">here</a> and <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/mous-for-nothing-and-data-for-free-4-new-mous-signed-between-the-ministry-of-agriculture-and-private-companies-including-amazon-and-patanjali/"">here</a>). In this post, we will be taking a closer look at some of the issues with the Agristack project, and how the provisions of the Personal Data Protection Bill may exacerbate such problems.
</p>
<h3><strong>The issue</strong></h3>
<p>The recently published <a href=""https://agricoop.nic.in/sites/default/files/IDEA%20Concept%20Paper_mod01062021_1.pdf"">Consultation Paper on IDEA-India Digital Ecosystem of Agriculture</a> by the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation, and Family Welfare proposed a digital architecture for the agricultural industry. This is a new addition to the rapidly developing Agristack in India. The Agristack is a collection of technologies and digital databases proposed by the Central Government focussing on India’s farmers and the agricultural sector. The central government has claimed that these new databases are being built to primarily tackle issues such as poor access to credit and wastage in the agricultural supply chain. It is important to understand why there is such keen interest in agricultural data.
</p>
<p>“<a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisaarthur/2013/08/15/what-is-big-data/?sh=539ca1df5c85"">Big Data</a>” can be defined as “<em>a collection of data from traditional and digital sources inside and outside your company that represents a source for ongoing discovery and analysis</em>”. The agricultural industry stands on the front line with other industries in the Big Data revolution. In agriculture, tremendous leaps in data acquisition equipment on everything from tractors to granaries coupled with instantaneous and continuous transmission of that data through cellular modems create a dataset soon to rival that of any industry. Yet, with the increased generation of agricultural data arises the concerns of data collection and usage.
</p>
<p>Here are some of the broader issues with Agristack so far:
</p>
<ol><li><strong>Implementation before consultation:</strong> As can be seen through the <a href=""https://agricoop.nic.in/en/farmingagreement"">signing of MoUs with several IT corporations</a>, it is alarming that without adequate consultations, MEITY has stated that the blueprint for Agristack is already in the advanced stage. While the agriculture sector would indeed benefit from the use of technology to aid both production and marketing, doing so in a manner that excludes the main intended beneficiaries may end up exacerbating existing problems.
</li><li><strong>Lack of representation:</strong> A clear lack of any consultation with farmers and a lack of representation in the task force. While private companies are being consulted, there has been insufficient to none engagement with the leading agricultural organizations and unions in India.
</li><li><strong>Loss of privacy:</strong> The proposed framework for Agristack does indeed face serious questions related to privacy. Farms generate a huge amount of data in their daily operations, and so are fertile ground for agritech and fintech firms. As has been seen before, this would lead to “<a href=""https://theconversation.com/farms-create-lots-of-data-but-farmers-dont-control-where-it-ends-up-and-who-can-use-it-115228"">banks and insurance companies [knowing] more about the incomes and businesses of farms than the individual farmers themselves</a>”.
</li><li><strong>No consent:</strong> A lack of farmers’ consent. Any system that uses a person’s data must have that person as a stakeholder in that system’s decision-making and governance process. Despite the fact that the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 mandates consent in processing personal data, farmers have not been informed or even involved in the conversation.
</li><li><strong>No protection:</strong> The paper states that it aims to “<em>(l)ay down clear policies specific to the agriculture domain that enable and regulate the sharing of data, in conformance with the applicable data protection regulations</em>” but currently we do not have any such data protection regulations in place. Moreover, the current Bill does not protect non-personal data. However, <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/unconstitutional-draft-report-on-non-personal-data-ignores-concerns-about-privacy-and-data-monopolies/"">MoUs signed with private companies like Amazon &amp; Patanjali</a> give them access to a lot of information, with no farmers' consent or security for pertinent data on their lands, income, loans, etc.
</li><li><strong>Inscrutable nature of the paper:</strong> The paper is daily ambiguous. Buzzwords such as “AI” and “ML” have been used without stating where exactly artificial intelligence models would be used. It has been reiterated that farmers would be economically benefited without explaining how. It is also unclear who owns IDEA. Furthermore, there are no grievance redressal mechanisms nor is it made clear what happens to farmers outside this system.
</li></ol><p>Overall, the IDEA paper and the proposed Agristack seem to benefit the government and private corporations more than the farmers. Agricultural data is being collected without the consent or consultation of farmers themselves, for the benefit of private agencies. In the absence of a data protection law, the consequent loss of privacy can negatively impact farmers in the following ways:
</p>
<ul><li>Financial lending models relying on technology towards farmers may offer extortionary rates for those in dire need.
</li><li>Given the incomplete nature of land title records, farmers may also be exploited by <a href=""https://grain.org/en/article/6529-digital-fences-the-financial-enclosure-of-farmlands-in-south-america"">land grabs by large agribusinesses.</a>
</li><li>Algorithm-based decision-making may further reduce the agency of farmers if and when AI-based decision-making becomes widespread, possibly impacting on legal rights.
</li></ul><h3>The PDP Bill and Farmers’ Rights</h3>
<p>The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (PDP) has no specific provisions for agricultural data. Thus, the treatment of agricultural data would depend on how it gets classified. Certain farm data may be classified as non-personal data. Non-personal data is not protected under the Bill, and is instead to be dealt with under a separate non-personal data governance framework. As we have <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/unconstitutional-draft-report-on-non-personal-data-ignores-concerns-about-privacy-and-data-monopolies/"">written earlier</a>, the currently proposed framework is quite lax and allows gross violations of user consent by providing entities the opportunity to exploit large datasets without much oversight. Thus, it is likely that non-personal agricultural data will be exploited.
</p>
<p>However, we already know that significant amounts of personal data will be processed under the Agristack framework (this was reiterated in the MoUs as well). Thus, we must also consider the future of agricultural data through this lens. Here, two main issues exist:
</p>
<ol><li><strong>Potential lack of consent: </strong>The Agristack is being rolled out under the aegis of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare. The Ministry also has plans to integrate the platform with several agriculture schemes being implemented by the government. Thus, under clause 12 of the Bill, which allows personal data to be processed without consent for the performance of a State function, farmers’ data may be harvested. Were this data to remain with the government, this may not have been as pressing an issue. However, given the proposed scale of integration in the Agristack, it is likely that private entities will also be able to easily access these datasets (especially if access to services becomes contingent upon the provision of said data). Clause 14, which allows the non-consensual processing of data for ‘reasonable purposes’ such as credit scoring and the operation of search engines, also seems to imply such a possibility.</li><li><strong>Constrained user rights: </strong>The Bill provides users with certain rights over their data. However, the Bill also sets certain limitations on the exercise of these rights, and from here stems the potential for misuse and exploitation. For example, clause 19 provides for the right to data portability but allows companies the leeway to deny such requests on grounds of technical infeasibility or protection of a trade secret. Alternatively, clause 20 allows data processors to reject requests under the right to be forgotten if it feels that the data in question has not served the purpose for which it was collected; the burden for proving this, of course, is on the user. Furthermore, clause 21 provides that users may be charged with fees for exercising these very rights. Now consider this in the context of the Agristack: will a farmer really be able to get a company to delete his/her data, given the significant difference in bargaining power? This will lead to farmers becoming beholden to the platform and the companies that are on it - this clearly cannot be good for farmer’s welfare! Moreover, the already <a href=""https://thewire.in/agriculture/dimensions-of-farmers-indebtedness-the-extent-of-indebtedness"">severely indebted farmers</a> may be asked to pay onerous fees for trying to assert their rights.
</li></ol><h3><strong>Solution</strong></h3>
<p>Other jurisdictions have laid down specific guidelines and laws for dealing with agricultural data. These include the <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20160527225756/https://www.fb.org/tmp/uploads/PrivacyAndSecurityPrinciplesForFarmData.pdf"">US American Farm Bureau Federations’ (AFBF) Privacy and Security Principles for Farm Data</a>, the <a href=""http://www.farmdatacode.org.nz/"">New Zealand Farm Data Code</a>, and the <a href=""https://copa-cogeca.eu/Archive/Download?id=3770357"">EU Code of Conduct on Agricultural Data Sharing by Contractual Agreement</a>. These codes cover central issues such as terminology, data ownership, data rights (including the right to access, data portability, and the right to erasure/right to be forgotten), privacy issues, security, consent, disclosure, and transparency. In addition, they all attempt to harness the benefits of agricultural data while protecting producers’ privacy and security.
</p>
<p>The AFBF championed <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20160527225756/https://www.fb.org/tmp/uploads/PrivacyAndSecurityPrinciplesForFarmData.pdf"">Privacy and Security Principles for Farm Data</a>, for example, is an agreement between influential farm organizations and Agriculture Technology Providers (ATP). It is an affirmation of belief (or promise) by the signatory ATPs that their business relationships should operate and data should be collected, used, and managed in accordance with the Farm Data Principles. Any Indian regulations protecting agricultural data must set clear expectations regarding a diverse set of interrelated data issues including education, ownership, collection, access, control, transparency, and more. Here are some of our recommendations:
</p>
<ol><li><strong>Comprehensive Consultations: </strong>There needs to be discussion on the merits of the proposal with farmer groups and unions on their very premise before any policy document is implemented. The utilisation of technology must happen on the basis of feedback that emerges from these conversations.
</li><li><strong>Long-term study and Advocacy: </strong>Academics, technologists, civil society and digital rights organisations to be engaged with on the development of the “Agristack” both as a policy framework and its execution proceeding from the concerns and experiences of farmers.
</li><li><strong>Privacy for Farmers:</strong> Examination of the relationship between personal data and digital policies such as the Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA) to be conducted in the context of the ongoing process of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Data Protection Bill.
</li><li><strong>Strengthen User Rights:</strong> The rights of users under the Bill have to be reviewed to ensure that the right to privacy of users gets primacy and the interests of data fiduciaries are addressed through limited exceptions.
</li><li><strong>Protecting non-personal data:</strong> Allow non-personal data to be regulated under the Data Protection Authority. This shifts the focus onto the protection of digital rights and the responsibility of providing robust regulatory mechanisms would fall on the Data Protection Authority. This also protects important data of farmers such as lands, income, loans, etc from being misused by private companies.
</li></ol><p>Given that in India, agriculture contributes to 19% of the country’s GDP (according to the <a href=""https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/economicsurvey/ebook_es2021/index.html"">Economic Survery 2020-21</a>) and provides employment to around 58% of the population, a lot more can and should be done to protect the interests, autonomy, and privacy of farmers.

<p>In our new weekly series #PrivacyOfThePeople, we look at the impact of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 on different sections of society. In the past, we’ve covered the effects of the Bill on worker surveillance and agricultural data. In this post, we discuss whether the Bill actually protects user data - specifically when it comes to social media platforms. We examine the need for stronger data protection regulation in a world where data generation is increasing exponentially. We also cover why protecting personal data alone achieves little.
</p>
<h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
<p>Last week, in the <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/privacy-of-the-people-agristack-and-farmer-issues/"">second post in our #PrivacyOfThePeople series</a>, we looked at agricultural data and farmers’ rights under the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. Specifically, we also discussed the Consultation Paper on IDEA by the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation, and Family Welfare. In the lack of adequate consultation, consent, or representation, the proposed Agristack seemed to benefit the government and private corporations more than the farmers. Farmers who are direct stakeholders of their own data must have greater say and better protection.
</p>
<p>This post continues to discuss how different groups of people are affected by the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, and so, for this week, we decided to look at social media users under the Bill. In the past, we have discussed user rights through our blog posts on <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectiontop10-on-the-need-to-protect/"">user rights</a> and <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/dataprotectiontop10-voluntary-social-media-verification/"">voluntary social media verification</a>. We have also detailed some essential features a <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/essential-features-of-a-rights-respecting-data-protection-law/"">rights-respecting data protection regulation must have</a>. In this post, we will be taking a closer look at the extent to which the Personal Data Protection Bill protects user data in the content of social media platforms.
</p>
<h3><strong>The issue</strong></h3>
<p>In today’s world, our increased dependence on technology has fuelled data creation exponentially. Google now processes <a href=""https://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/"">40,000 search queries</a> every second. According to <a href=""https://www.domo.com/learn/infographic/data-never-sleeps-8"">DOMO’s ‘Data Never Sleeps’</a>, every minute of the day - WhatsApp users share over 41 million messages, Instagram users post 300,000 stories, and LinkedIn users apply for over 69,000 jobs. The fact of the matter is that there’s an enormously high amount of data being generated every second merely by engaging with such platforms. While most companies collect user data for the purposes of targeted advertising or website management, the amount of personal and non-personal data they collect varies. In the absence of any data protection regulation, your data may most likely end up with anyone from a researcher to an advertiser to a foreign intelligence agency.
</p>
<p>The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 - soon to be India’s first data protection law is definitely a step in the right direction. The Bill intends to regulate the collection, usage, storage, and transmission of personal data of individuals (data principals) by the government and private companies (data fiduciaries). We’ve <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/essential-features-of-a-rights-respecting-data-protection-law/"">previously written</a> about some of the essential features a rights-respecting data protection regulation must have.
</p>
<p>In a data protection regime that claims to be rights-based, it is imperative that the users are given certain rights against the data fiduciaries. These rights are essential for the users to exercise control over their personal data. As detailed in our <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/startfromscratch-an-explainer-on-the-personal-data-protection-bill-2019/"">explainer on the Bill</a>, Chapter V of the Bill grants users the Right to confirmation and access, the Right to correction and erasure, the Right to data portability, and the Right to be forgotten. Yet data fiduciaries can reject all of these requests if they choose to, and there are no mechanisms in place to contest their decision.
</p>
<p>How well does the Bill really protect us when it comes to using social media platforms? Let us take a look at what the PDP Bill has to say about user data that is collected by data fiduciaries, who owns this data, and how it is shared.
</p>
<h3>The PDP Bill and Social Media</h3>
<p>Under the PDP Bill, a data fiduciary (including social media intermediaries) is required to obtain consent for collecting data under Section 7, and consent for processing under Section 11. While seeking consent (by providing notice to a data principal at the time of collection of personal data) under Section 7, a data fiduciary must state the purposes for which the personal data is to be processed under Section 7(1)(a), and inform a data principal about the individuals or entities including other data fiduciaries or data processors with whom such personal data may be shared under Section 7(1)(g). In this context, under Section 11(3), explicit consent is required for processing any sensitive personal data. Furthermore, a data principal must be made aware of the sharing of any personal/sensitive personal data with a third party through a notice under Section 7(1)(g). Thus, the Bill does a fair job at protecting users’ personal data.
</p>
<p>Yet, the Bill could be greatly improved in the following regards:
</p>
<ol><li><strong>Ownership not clearly defined:</strong> The Bill is extremely vague in the ownership of user data. A model example is <a href=""https://iapp.org/resources/article/brazilian-data-protection-law-lgpd-english-translation/"">Brazil’s General Data Protection Law, 2018</a>, which explicitly states “every natural person is assured ownership of his/her personal data”. The ambiguity in our Bill, however, creates great potential for misuse. Even if you have “nothing to hide”, your data may end up in the wrong hands without your knowledge.
</li><li><strong>Non-personal and anonymized data is ignored:</strong> While the Bill largely applies to personal data, non-personal and anonymous data are exempted from the provisions meant to protect user data. The Central government can use Section 91 of the Bill to direct entities to share anonymized and non-personal data with it. In today’s world, it is nearly impossible for everyday users of the internet to achieve true anonymity. One of the landmark cases in deanonymization is <a href=""https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/shmat_oak08netflix.pdf"">this report</a> on a 2008 Netflix dataset of users and their movie ratings - with just 8 movie ratings, 99% of records were uniquely identified in the dataset.
</li><li><strong>Government access to data:</strong> Section 91 provides a carve-out for the Central Government to access anonymized or non-personal data to frame policies in the interest of its digital economy. The government is exempted from providing an objective for data collection and processing. The state-authorized data should be addressed in a more transparent and accountable way so that the class of persons getting affected from such processing could be given a reason or justification for the need for processing. We believe that a data protection law should not be used as a legislative backdoor to commodify data.
</li><li><strong>Inadequate user rights:</strong> Lastly, the current Bill creates impediments to exercise the rights that the users do have. Data fiduciaries can reject user requests for “<em>correction, completion, updation, or erasure</em>” if they disagree with your requests, even though it involves your data. Furthermore, there is no means in place to contest the decision made by data fiduciaries if they reject your requests.
</li></ol><h3><strong>Solution</strong></h3>
<p>To remedy the aforementioned issues, here are some of our recommendations:
</p>
<ol><li><strong>Renew User Rights:</strong> According to the <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/principles"">first principle</a> of the Indian Privacy Code, individual rights should be at the center of privacy and data protection. Therefore, the <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf"">rights of users under the Bill have to be reviewed</a> to ensure that the right to privacy of users gets primacy and the interests of data fiduciaries are addressed through limited exceptions.
</li><li><strong>Inclusion and treatment of Social Media Intermediaries:</strong> The Bill requires social media platforms identified as “significant data fiduciaries” to set up infrastructure which allows users in India to voluntarily verify their accounts. This measure hampers online anonymity and thereby the right to privacy. Additionally, it will allow social media entities to access people's government-issued identity documents. This can lead to the aggregation of demographic information across companies and databases. This creates immense scope for companies to build granular user profiles and commercialise personal and sensitive personal data of individuals.
</li><li><strong>Protect Non-Personal Data:</strong> Allow non-personal and anonymized data to be regulated by the Data Protection Authority. Doing so would shift the focus onto the protection of citizens’ digital rights and ensure robust regulatory mechanisms for non-personal data.
</li><li><strong>Advocate for Data Minimisation:</strong> Data fiduciaries should not collect more data than they need. There needs to be a greater discussion on the kind of data companies require and their goals cannot compromise the basic privacy of people.

<p>In the continuation of our weekly series #PrivacyOfThePeople, we look at the impact of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 on different sections of society. In the past, we’ve covered the effects of the Bill on worker surveillance and agricultural data. In this post, we examine the Bill in relation to healthcare data. We explore the need to secure such data as well as why private companies and foreign hackers are interested in the data of senior citizens.
</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Last week, in the <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/privacyofthepeople-social-media-users/"">third post in our #PrivacyOfThePeople series</a>, we looked at social media user rights under the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. We took a deep dive into the merits and demerits of the Bill when it comes to the common person and data fiduciaries. Users of any social media platform who are direct stakeholders of their own data must have greater say and better protection in this increasingly digital world.
</p>
<p>This post continues to discuss how different groups of people are affected by the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019.This week, we’re taking a look at why there is an increasing interest in healthcare data and medical records and whether the Bill adequately protects such data. In the past, we have discussed privacy-related concerns in healthcare through our <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gza8WXnY9nLfB2BdRWyRe32Y--KxyJ-P/view"">explainer on the Unique Health Identifier Rules</a> and our analysis of the <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/analysing-the-ndhms-health-data-management-policy-part-1/"">National Digital Health Mission’s health Data Management Policy</a>.
</p>
<h3>The issue</h3>
<p>In a world where everything is becoming increasingly digital, each industry is facing a unique set of challenges that come with digitization. As such, in the health sector, digital technologies are being deployed for overcoming inefficiencies, ensuring better utilization of available resources, delivering certain services and follow-up, etc, for faster data collection. In a country with more than one billion people, any sort of data is bound to be scattered, even more so when it comes to healthcare data. As these records and databases transition to an online setting, healthcare organizations face an uphill challenge to protect this data. According to the US <a href=""https://www.hipaajournal.com/healthcare-data-breach-statistics/"">Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights,</a> between 2009 and 2020, 3,705 healthcare data breaches of 500 or more records have been reported.
</p>
<p>To understand why there is an increased interest in healthcare data, we must first understand what exactly is healthcare data? As per the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM), health data can be classified into the following categories:
</p>
<ul><li><strong>Personal health data</strong> – data related to an individual containing detailed information of various health conditions and treatments. It includes any data with personally identifiable information of various stakeholders, such as healthcare professionals; and
</li><li><strong>Non-personal health data –</strong> includes aggregate health data and anonymised health data where all personally identifiable information has been removed.
</li></ul><p>Why is it then, that the value of medical records on the web surpasses that of social security and credit card numbers? According to Tom Kellermann, chief cybersecurity officer of Carbon Black, “Health information is a treasure trove for criminals. By compromising it, by stealing it, by having it sold, you have 7 to 10 personal identifying characteristics of an individual.” A lot of healthcare data is sensitive personal data. Not only is this data sensitive, but it is also of great value to brokers who sell this data to private agencies and researchers. This is clearly evidenced by one of the <a href=""https://thewire.in/health/hackers-attack-indian-healthcare-website-steal-68-lakh-records-report"">largest Indian healthcare data breaches in 2019 when cyber criminals had stolen 68 lakh records</a> of patient and doctor information. This breach contained Personally Identifiable Information (PII). According to <a href=""https://www.protenus.com/resources/2020-breach-barometer"">another report</a>, over 41.4 million patient records were breached worldwide in 2020 alone. This has alarming consequences.
</p>
<p>A number of things can happen with stolen healthcare data. Traditional criminals may resort to <a href=""https://healthtechmagazine.net/article/2019/10/what-happens-stolen-healthcare-data-perfcon"">coercion and extortion</a> by using your information. Others may commit <a href=""https://healthinformatics.uic.edu/blog/why-data-security-is-the-biggest-concern-of-health-care/"">identity theft</a>. One of the most common places your data may eventually end up, however, is at insurance companies. In fact, hospitals in the US r<a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-08-08/your-medical-records-are-for-sale"">egularly sell medical information</a> to data mining companies who then aggregate the data and resell it to private practitioners, insurance companies, etc. While both secondary use and sale of medical data are anonymised beforehand, <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-data-brokers-make-money-off-your-medical-records/"">several reports</a> have revealed the possibility of identifying people even based on such disparate information. Such practices <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2014/04/16/data-mining-is-now-used-to-set-insurance-rates-critics-cry-fowl.html"">can result</a> in an increase in insurance premiums and targeted advertising, leaving very little control over such sensitive information with the patient themselves.

<p>In the absence of stringent data protection regulations, your parents’ and grandparents’ data can end up with foreign researchers or helping insurance companies profit.

<h2>The PDP Bill and Health Data</h2>
<p>Under section 3(21) of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (PDPB), ‘health data’ is the ‘data related to the state of physical or mental health of the data principal and includes records regarding the past, present or future state of the health of such data principal, data collected in the course of registration for, or provision of health services, data associating the data principal to the provision of specific health services’. Further, under section 3(36) of PDP 2019, ‘sensitive personal data’ refers to personal data that may reveal, be related to, or constitute health data, among others. At present, the Bill is silent on non-personal and anonymized data. As we have <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/unconstitutional-draft-report-on-non-personal-data-ignores-concerns-about-privacy-and-data-monopolies/"">written extensively earlier</a>, protecting personal data alone solves only half of the problem - non-personal data needs to be thoroughly regulated as well. In today’s world, it is nearly impossible for everyday users of the internet to achieve true anonymity. Indeed, many studies have already shown how anonymised data can be de-anonymised and used to identify individuals (see <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022000014000683"">here</a> and <a href=""http://palms.ee.princeton.edu/system/files/Quantification+of+De-anonymization+Risks+in+Social+Networks.pdf"">here</a>).
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Bill fails to adequately safeguard data of any sort in the case of data breaches. Clause 25 which deals with the breach of personal data states that in cases where a data breach may cause harm to the data principal, the data fiduciary must inform the Data Protection Authority. However, the clause does not require the data fiduciary to inform the data principal (in this case, users whose healthcare data is now public). It is instead left to the Authority to decide: a) whether the data fiduciary must inform the data principal, b) the remedial action the data fiduciary must undertake, and c) the details of the data breach that can be made public. Moreover, there are no penalties imposed on the data fiduciaries in the event of a data breach. Given that the systems the digital healthcare industry rely on are <a href=""https://www.financialexpress.com/lifestyle/health/national-digital-health-mission-puts-the-spotlight-on-indias-health-data-security/2094277/"">already severely vulnerable to cyber attacks</a>, the lack of penalties disincentivises enterprises from adopting more robust security standards..
</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>To remedy some of the aforementioned issues, here are our recommendations:
</p>
<ol><li><strong>Clearly identifying the need, purpose, and safeguards for healthcare data:</strong> It has been argued that since the medical community is still divided over the impact of digital health records on clinical outcomes, there is a need to comprehensively study the same in the context of efficacy and privacy concerns. Lessons from studies from other countries may also be beneficial. For example, a survey of general physicians in Australia found that they accessed only a tiny fraction of all the reports uploaded onto the database. To this extent, the government must also hold consultations with diverse stakeholders to calibrate this framework towards a focus on improving medical outcomes (rather than on data collection). Hence, a transparent, consultative approach with public health groups, independent academics, and experts, digital rights organisations needs to be conducted on priority.
</li><li><strong>Protect Non-Personal Data:</strong> Allow non-personal and anonymized data to be regulated by the Data Protection Authority. Doing so would shift the focus onto the protection of citizens’ digital rights and ensure robust regulatory mechanisms for non-personal data.
</li><li><strong>Strengthen the security framework: </strong>Companies must provide users with explanation of security practices and safeguards that their data will be subject to. Additionally, in case of a breach or hack, users must be informed about the incident and give details about the extent to which their data has been affected.

<p>The report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 is to be submitted next week. Here, we look at the possible ways forward for the Bill, highlight some of the issues that may emerge, and provide recommendations for addressing them.
</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Last year, several <a href=""https://www.business-standard.com/budget/article/budget-2021-personal-data-protection-bill-likely-to-be-tabled-in-parl-120100400544_1.html"">media reports</a> indicated that the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 would submit its report to the Parliament during the Budget session. However, as we know, that did not happen. In fact, on March 25, 2021 <a href=""http://loksabhaph.nic.in/Business/ListofBusiness.aspx"">a motion was moved</a> to extend the time for the presentation of the report and <a href=""http://loksabhaph.nic.in/Business/UserBulletin1.aspx"">was adopted the very same day</a>. Thus, the report of the Committee is now scheduled to be presented in the first week of the upcoming Monsoon Session i.e. <a href=""http://loksabhaph.nic.in/Business/UserBulletin2.aspx"">the week starting 19th July</a>. The speaker of the Lok Sabha has also explicitly stated that <a href=""https://www.medianama.com/2021/07/223-pdp-no-extension-om-birla/"">no further extension will be granted to the committee</a>.
</p>
<p>In recent time, we have written extensively on the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 through:
</p>
<ul><li>Our <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/constitutional-utopias-of-digital-protection/"">#StartFromScratch series</a>, which was a short introduction to the Bill which included some historical and legislative context, a summary of the Bill, an overview of the issues with the Bill, and possible alternative paradigms for data protection.
</li><li>Next, through our <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/tag/dataprotectiontop10/"">#DataProtectionTop10 series</a>, wherein we analysed the top 10 issues with the Bill in detail.
</li><li>Currently, through our <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/tag/privacyofthepeople/"">#PrivacyOfThePeople series</a> which is looking at how the Bill will impact our daily lives by focusing on its impact on different sections of society
</li></ul><p>However, now that Session is almost here, we thought it would be helpful to look at the potential ways forward for the JPC, and indeed answer the question: what will happen to the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 now?
</p>
<h3>The Report of the Committee</h3>
<p>Once the Committee submits its report under Rule 77 of the <a href=""http://loksabhaph.nic.in/rules/rules.pdf"">Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha</a> (‘Lok Sabha Rules’), there are several options available for moving forward:
</p>
<ol><li>The Bill along with the modifications proposed by the JPC can be taken up for consideration.
</li><li>The Bill can once again be given back to the JPC (this could be the same committee or even a newly constituted committee).
</li><li>The Bill can be circulated amongst the members of the Lok Sabha to elicit further opinion thereon.
</li></ol><p>If option 1 is chosen i.e. if the modified Bill is taken up for consideration, then Members of Parliament retain the option of moving a motion asking for the Bill to be sent back to the JPC or that it be circulated among MPs for deliberation.
</p>
<p>In the case of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, it is likely that option 1 will be taken, as discussions on the Bill have been going on since 2018 and MPs will be hesitant to send the Bill back to the JPC again. Thus, it would seem that everything is now done and dusted: the report will be tabled, the Government will introduce a new version of the Bill, and, given the numbers, the Bill will most probably pass.
</p>
<h3>Potential Issues</h3>
<p>However, the picture isn’t over yet. For starters, Rule 331D of the Lok Sabha Rules clearly states that a Minister cannot be appointed as a member of the Committee. Now, during the recent cabinet reshuffle, 5 members of the Committee -<a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tenure-of-panel-on-data-protection-bill-wont-be-extended-any-more-speaker/articleshow/84396151.cms""> Meenakshi Lekhi, Ajay Bhatt, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, Bhupender Yadav, and Ashwini Vaishnaw</a> - were appointed as Ministers. This means that, immediately, there are now 5 vacancies in the JPC. In fact, MP Meenakshi Lekhi was the chairperson of the JPC, so as of now the JPC is also sans chairperson!
</p>
<p>Another is that, as multiple sources have suggested, the report may <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-reshuffle-may-delay-first-data-privacy-law-101625772399368.html"">substantially expand the scope of the Bill to include non-personal data</a>. Currently, clause 91 of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 allows the government to frame policies for regulating non-personal data. The Committee of Experts on Non-Personal Data Governance Framework had released the second draft of its report for the proposed governance framework on December 16th, 2020. However, the framework proposed by the committee may be unconstitutional. Four major concerns emerge form the framework:
</p>
<ul><li><strong>Overbroad definitions:</strong> The report provides an extremely broad definition of non-personal data by defining it in opposition to personal data as defined in the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019.<a href=""https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=804ce9b8-dfa5-4c67-bbf7-4cc3e087c2f8.""> Issues arise in the context of both implementation and jurisprudence</a> when trying to ascertain whether a given piece of data is ‘personal’ or ‘non-personal’. The proposed relationship between the Bill and the framework may also not adequately address concerns about privacy and data security.
</li><li><strong>Risk of de-anonymisation: </strong>As the report itself has noted, the threat of de-anonymization is a grave one against which adequate barriers must be maintained. Given that a large portion of non-personal data will consist of anonymised personal data, it is vital that such issues be dealt with. The relative ease of de-anonymization has already been highlighted in various contexts (see <a href=""https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=804ce9b8-dfa5-4c67-bbf7-4cc3e087c2f8."">here</a> and <a href=""https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=804ce9b8-dfa5-4c67-bbf7-4cc3e087c2f8."">here</a>), while the situation in India is worsened by the lack of adequate data protection legislation.
</li><li><strong>Over-extraction of data and a race to the bottom:</strong> The proposed version of the governance framework may enable data maximisation, wherein <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/31/personal-data-corporate-use-google-amazon"">there is overreach in data collection by various entities</a>. Besides the natural issues related to consent, the economic rationale given to bolster the claim that a profusion of data generation and conclusion may not hold up, and may instead <a href=""https://www.epw.in/engage/article/politics-indias-data-protection-ecosystem"">lead to the exploitation of citizens</a>. Any engagement with data monopolies and market failure in the realm of data has been cursory at best and here domains of competition law remain underutilized in India.
</li></ul><p>Should such provisions for regulating non-personal data be included within the Bill, then these would constitute a significant change in the ambit of the Bill, and so, under the <a href=""https://legislative.gov.in/documents/pre-legislative-consultation-policy"">pre legislative consultation policy</a>, require a further round of consultation.
</p>
<p>Lastly, in a democratic country, the government must be held accountable. Currently, it is possible that the Government accepts the report of the Committee and then proceeds to wholly disregard its suggestions. This may not be in accordance with a democratic ethos, and so it is imperative that when the government finally presents the modified Bill, it also provides its rationale for either accepting or rejecting each of the recommendations of the JPC.
</p>
<h3><strong>Suggestions</strong></h3>
<p>In light of these issues, we have the following suggestions;
</p>
<ol><li><strong>Fill vacancies: </strong>It is within the power of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha to appoint a chairperson, given the urgency of the matter. This must happen immediately, so that the process is not held up due to administrative difficulties.
</li><li><strong>Fresh round of consultation if substantial changes are present:</strong> The non-personal data governance framework proposed by the government has several issues. If such a framework is to be enshrined through the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, this is a grave worry, and so conducting new consultations would be essential.
</li><li><strong>Provide rationale for decision:</strong> A democratic government must be accountable for its actions, and so it is of paramount importance that, before presenting the final version of the Bill, the government provides its reasons for accepting or rejecting each suggestion of the JPC.

<p>In the continuation of our weekly series #PrivacyOfThePeople, we look at the impact of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 on different sections of society, from farmers to patients. In this post, we examine the growing interest in students’ data and what the Bill has to say when it comes to student data. We explore the need to secure such data as well as why current regulations inadequately protect student data.
</p>
<h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
<p>Last week, in the <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/will-indias-healthcare-data-be-protected-privacy-of-the-people/"">fourth post in our #PrivacyOfThePeople series</a>, we looked at healthcare data under the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. We took a deep dive into the merits and demerits of the Bill when it comes to protecting the medical records of patients. In the past, we have also covered the impacts of the Bill on <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/privacyofthepeople-asha-workers-and-employee-surveillance/"">workers</a>, <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/privacy-of-the-people-agristack-and-farmer-issues/"">farmers</a>, and <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/privacyofthepeople-social-media-users/"">social media users</a>.
</p>
<p>This post continues to discuss how different groups of people are affected by the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. This week, we’re taking a look at why there is an increasing interest in student data and whether the Bill adequately protects such data. Specifically, student data largely entails the data of students and their guardians, which is collected and processed by schools, colleges, governmental organisations, and ed-tech companies.
</p>
<h3><strong>The issue</strong></h3>
<p>According to a <a href=""https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/us-schools-data-breaches/"">Comparitech report</a>, US schools and colleges have leaked 24.5 million student records in 1,327 data breaches since the year 2005. This is now a global issue that has become much more relevant in India, even more so with the increased digitization of student records due to the COVID-19 pandemic. From admission right up to graduation, educational institutions constantly collect, store, process, and generate huge amounts of data. This data can intentionally or unintentionally end up in someone else’s hands. In a 2018 data breach, <a href=""https://www.business-standard.com/article/education/data-of-250-000-neet-students-being-sold-online-118071800828_1.html"">the information of 250,000 students who appeared for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) was being publicly sold</a>, without the consent or knowledge of the students. The personal data had been obtained by merely requesting schools and offering free NEET mock tests. Just this year, staff and education officers in Coimbatore had been <a href=""https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2021/jul/12/tamil-nadu-school-education-department-officials-selling-students-data-2328770.html"">allegedly selling student data</a> using the Education Information Management System (EMIS) portal.
</p>
<p>At the time of admission, schools may typically ask for names, ages, addresses, photographs, sex, religion, Aadhaar numbers, birth certificates, details of siblings, parents’ names, parents’ qualifications, family income, telephone numbers, email addresses, etc. Once admitted, financial data such as bank account details, and health data such as blood group, allergies, weight, height, immunizations, regular medication (if any), dental check-ups, eye check-ups, etc. are also usually added. Additionally, most schools maintain progress reports, participation details, and disciplinary records of students. Schools thus regularly collect and process large amounts of personal data of not only students but also their guardians. The question then arises - “What happens to this student data?”
</p>
<p>Unlike other kinds of data, student data is a lot more comprehensive - it is several fields of a student’s and guardian’s personal data. This makes it of much greater interest to data broker companies that buy and sell information about consumers from a wide variety of sources. This student data can end up anywhere. It generally ends up with companies providing services such as coaching facilities, educational loans, insurance, or regular advertising. Colleges too may be interested in obtaining data from schools. While there have been <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/jordanshapiro/2014/01/24/your-kids-school-may-have-the-right-to-sell-student-data/?sh=33af352a68b5"">cases where schools themselves have played a role in selling student data</a>, most of the time, this is done without the management’s knowledge. Apart from this data profiting others, it even risks the possibilities of phishing, extortion, and ending up on pornographic websites.
</p>
<p>This issue isn’t limited to schools alone, but also extends to universities, ed-tech companies, governmental and private boards and organizations that manage curriculums and conduct various examinations. <a href=""https://www.consumerreports.org/colleges-universities/college-board-is-sharing-student-data-once-again/"">The College Board is notorious when it comes to selling student data</a>. The American organisation popularly known for conducting exams such as the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT), was <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-sale-sat-takers-names-colleges-buy-student-data-and-boost-exclusivity-11572976621"">reported to be selling test-takers’ information to elite universities for 47 cents per name</a>. These universities use this data to boost their image of exclusivity (by inviting students they don’t intend on accepting to apply and pay a good application fee), in an attempt to help boost their national rankings.
</p>
<p><strong>The PDP Bill and Student Data</strong>
</p>
<p>Schools, universities, educational organisations, and ed-tech companies, all classify as “data fiduciaries” (data collectors) for the purposes of the PDP Bill. As such, they are required to fulfill all obligations under Chapter II, that is, Sections 4 to 11, particularly those dealing with purpose limitation, the requirement of consent, etc., as well as the accountability and transparency measures specified in Chapter VI. Since these groups inevitably process large volumes of personal data of children, they will also be regulated as guardian data fiduciaries for the purpose of Chapter IV of the Bill and the regulations made under them. Yet, since the Bill only protects personal data, non-personal student data is still at risk. <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/unconstitutional-draft-report-on-non-personal-data-ignores-concerns-about-privacy-and-data-monopolies/"">As we have written extensively earlier</a>, in today’s world anonymised data means very little.
</p>
<p>Considering the volume and sensitivity of personal data processed, the Data Protection Authority (DPA) may also seek to regulate schools as Significant Data Fiduciaries under Section 26 of the Bill. Government-run schools may also be regulated differently if they are classified as a “service provided by a government” under Section 12(a)(i) of the Bill.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Bill fails to adequately safeguard data of any sort in the case of data breaches. Clause 25 which deals with the breach of personal data states that in cases where a data breach may cause harm to the data principal, the data fiduciary must inform the Data Protection Authority, not the principal themself. Moreover, there are no penalties imposed on the data fiduciaries in the event of a data breach.
</p>
<h3><strong>Solution</strong></h3>
<p>To remedy some of these problems, here are a few of our recommendations:
</p>
<ol><li><strong>Schools, colleges, organisations, and ed-tech companies to process data responsibly: </strong>This is to be done in compliance with the PDP Bill. If any sort of data processors are hired, they will need to be monitored to ensure compliance. Such data processors may only be appointed vide a contract and are bound by the instructions of the Data Fiduciary and must treat data as confidential as per Section 31 of the Bill.
</li><li><strong>Student Rights must be upheld:</strong> As stakeholders of their data, explicit consent should be taken before processing any data. If data is being monetized, students and their guardians must be made aware of this. Under Section 9 of the Bill, students, as data principals, have the right to ask for the erasure of their data at any given time. Processing of student data must not be done in a way that profits others when it violates basic privacy rights.
</li><li><strong>Protect Non-Personal Data:</strong> Allow non-personal and anonymized data to be regulated by the Data Protection Authority. Doing so would shift the focus onto the protection of citizens’ digital rights and ensure robust regulatory mechanisms for non-personal data.

</p>
<p>This post continues to discuss how different groups of people are affected by the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. This week, we’re taking a look at dating and matrimonial services - notoriously known for sharing personal data and what the Bill has to say on the same.
</p>
<h3>The Issue</h3>
<p>According to <a href=""https://web.stanford.edu/~mrosenfe/Rosenfeld_et_al_Disintermediating_Friends.pdf"">several studies</a>, connecting online is now the most preferred way to meet new people, increasingly so amongst young adults. An estimated <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-match-group-results-idUSKBN2A22V1"">66 million people</a> use the popular dating app Tinder alone. Whether you’re trying to meet new people, searching for a match on Valentine’s Day, or looking for a potential spouse - dating and matrimonial platforms (collectively known as GeoSocial Networking platforms) are constantly collecting and processing large amounts of personal data. This data can include your gender, date of birth, location, racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, more intricate details regarding personality, lifestyle, interactions on the platform, and interests. What’s most alarming is that most of these platforms actually store your messages (sent and received), pictures, and videos, and can retain this data indefinitely. What’s worse? If you connect any of these services to your social media platforms such as Facebook or Instagram, the dating app company has <a href=""https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/14/21137096/how-tinder-matches-work-algorithm-grindr-bumble-hinge-algorithms"">access to thousands of additional data points on you</a>.
</p>
<p>In a world of big data, dating and matrimonial platforms are regularly leaking this very personal information. In 2020, a Norwegian consumer group found dating apps like <a href=""https://www.indiatvnews.com/technology/news-dating-apps-like-tinder-okcupid-leak-personal-information-579729"">Tinder, Grindr, and OkCupid guilty of sharing their users’ personal information</a> with thousands of advertising partners. It was revealed in 2018 that <a href=""https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/azeenghorayshi/grindr-hiv-status-privacy"">Grindr had been sharing the HIV status of their users</a> with 2 third-party companies (Apptimize and Localytics). This extremely sensitive information was coupled with the users’ GPS data, phone number, and email ID, according to the Norwegian nonprofit <a href=""https://github.com/SINTEF-9012/grindr-privacy-leaks"">SINTEF</a>. This is a chilling violation of user privacy.
</p>
<p>This issue of violating privacy isn’t limited to dating apps alone. Love Vivaah is an Indian matrimonial site that promises to find you a life partner from over 1 million Aadhaar-verified profiles. In this ‘genuine’ matrimonial site, <a href=""https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/india/violating-sc-rules-matrimonial-site-sells-love-marriage-using-aadhaar-data"">users are required to give their Aadhaar card details in order to create a profile</a>. Apart from the fact that requiring Aadhaar based verification may contravene the Supreme Court’s judgement in the <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/127517806/"">Puttaswamy case</a>, sharing one’s Aadhaar information involves <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/aadhaar-undermines-informational-privacy-and-data-protection/"">a certain risk to one’s privacy</a>.
</p>
<p>If such services aren’t giving away your data, they’re certainly not protecting it either. In a serious data breach last year, <a href=""https://gizmodo.com/70-000-tinder-photos-of-women-just-got-dumped-on-a-cybe-1841043456"">over 70,000 photos of female Tinder users were leaked online</a>. Given that it is necessary to upload a photo of yourself in order to make a profile on Tinder, the company is duty-bound to protect such data. In 2020, the <a href=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/personal-data-of-bharatmatriony-users-breached-says-security-firm-cyble-inc/articleshow/78687130.cms?from=mdr"">personal data of Bharatmatrimony users was breached</a>, but the platform faced no consequences. As we have seen earlier, such data often ends up in the hands of data brokers who will sell your data to anyone from a<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/13/technology/grindr-apps-dating-data-tracking.html"">dvertising agencies to researchers</a> - and that’s if you’re lucky. The nature of data that’s taken from dating apps can also end up in <a href=""https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/14/21137096/how-tinder-matches-work-algorithm-grindr-bumble-hinge-algorithms"">pornographic websites, used in phishing, or fraud</a>.
</p>
<h3>The PDP Bill</h3>
<p>The PDP Bill extends the definition of sensitive personal data to include not just gender and health information, but also religious affiliation, caste or tribe, and an expanded notion of financial information. Under the Bill, personal data may be processed subject to <em>valid consent</em>, which means consent that is free, informed, specific, clear and capable of being withdrawn. In addition, processing sensitive personal data requires explicit consent, which means consent obtained must (i) inform the data subject about the purpose processing which may cause significant harm, (ii) be direct and not inferred, and (iii) be separate for different purposes and categories of sensitive personal data. Since the Bill only protects personal data, non-personal user data is still at risk. <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/unconstitutional-draft-report-on-non-personal-data-ignores-concerns-about-privacy-and-data-monopolies/"">As we have written extensively earlier</a>, in today’s world anonymised data means very little.
</p>
<p>The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) separately addresses automated/algorithmic decision-making. This means data principals have rights like notification, access, and objection if subjected to purely automated decisions. The Indian Bill, however, does not draw such a distinction.<br />Furthermore, the Bill fails to adequately safeguard data of any sort in the case of data breaches. Clause 25 which deals with the breach of personal data states that in cases where a data breach may cause harm to the data principal, the data fiduciary (the GeoSocial Networking platform) must inform the Data Protection Authority, not the principal themself. Moreover, there are no penalties imposed on the data fiduciaries in the event of a data breach
</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>To remedy some of these problems, here are a few of our recommendations:
</p>
<ol><li><strong>Dating and matrimonial platforms to process data responsibly:</strong> This is to be done in compliance with the PDP Bill. If any sort of data processors are hired, they will need to be monitored to ensure compliance. Such data processors may only be appointed vide a contract and are bound by the instructions of the data fiduciary and must treat data as confidential as per Section 31 of the Bill.
</li><li><strong>Messages of GeoSocial Networking platforms should be encrypted:</strong> While the messages sent between users on such GeoSocial Networking platforms like Tinder are secure at the server level, they are not end-to-end encrypted or safe from data breaches or third-party access. The onus falls on the companies providing such services to protect the messages of their users.
</li><li><strong>Protect Non-Personal Data:</strong> Allow non-personal and anonymized data to be regulated by the Data Protection Authority. Doing so would shift the focus onto the protection of citizens’ digital rights and ensure robust regulatory mechanisms for non-personal data.

<p>The e-commerce giant Amazon, a vendor on the platform named ‘Shastri Nagar Charkya Puri’, two websites, namely, “Students Database India” &amp; “Students Database”, and shockingly a few government and school management officials have reportedly compromised the personal information of Class X and Class XII students across the country. Concerned about the threat to children's privacy and safety caused by such data breaches, in July 2021, IFF sent thirty-two representations to the State and Union Territory Commissions for the Protection of Child Rights in India and filed three Right to Information (RTI) requests with the Central Board of School Education (CBSE), National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) and the Ministry of Education’s Department of School Education and Literacy.
</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>In June 2021, <a href=""https://ukhrultimes.com/nagaland-bihar-haryana-students-personal-database-on-sale-on-amazon-serious-data-breach/"">Ukhrul Times</a>, <a href=""https://nagalandexpress.com/nagaland/nagaland-students-database-available-for-sale-in-amazon-parents-raise-concern/"">Nagaland Express</a>, and <a href=""https://www.indiatimes.com/technology/news/indian-students-data-selling-online-scam-543039.html"">India Times</a> broke the news of a pan-India personal data breach of Class X and Class XII students. Alarmingly, their names, father’s names, physical addresses, institution names, and even contact details including phone numbers and email addresses were revealed in these databases. The main individuals/entities involved in facilitating the sale of such information are:<br /></p>
<p><strong>A. <strong><strong>Shastri Nagar Charkya Puri and Amazon</strong></strong></strong>
</p>
<p>According to Ukhrul Times, a trader named ‘Shastri Nagar Charkya Puri’ collated the personal data of students to create the ‘Bihar Student Database’, ‘Haryana Student Database’, and ‘Nagaland Student Database’. What’s more concerning is that the e-commerce giant Amazon, which has <a href=""https://findly.in/amazon-statistics/"">over 100 million Indian users registered</a>, facilitated ‘Shastri Nagar Charkya Puri’ in selling the databases priced at Rs. 299. The Nagaland Express has also reported that Shastri Nagar Charkya Puri claims that the data is “latest and verified”. In addition, the report suggests that Shastri Nagar Charkya Puri and Amazon have not made any effort to inform the students whose privacy has been compromised. Only after several parents raised concerns and reported the item to Amazon, was the link to purchase the student database taken down.
</p>
<p><strong>B.<strong><strong> Database and Students Database India</strong></strong></strong>
</p>
<p>In addition to ‘Shastri Nagar Charkya Puri’, two websites, namely, “<a href=""https://studentsdatabase.in/"">Students Database</a>” and “<a href=""http://www.studentdatabaseindia.com/"">Students Database India</a>” are also selling the personal data of Indian children. The “Student Database” website presents a “record count” of the number of students whose data has been collated to prepare the database. On calculating the All India Class XII CBSE 2020-21 batch’s record count presented by the website, IFF learned that 13,14,756 children’s personal information has been compromised. In addition to the All India databases, this website has also put up region-specific databases for sale, each of which provides “free samples” of the student data. Further, the website also provides sixteen student databases at no cost. This leaves a whopping 9,04,963 students’ personal data freely available.
</p>
<p>The database gives purchasers access to extremely sensitive information such as the student’s name, mobile number, gender, email address, and age. While Amazon had taken down the page to purchase the student databases sold by ‘Shastri Nagar Charkya Puri’, the two aforementioned websites are still operating.
</p>
<p><strong>C. <strong><strong>Government Departments and School Managements</strong></strong></strong>
</p>
<p>The institutions created to safeguard the data of students are now reported to have partaken in the non-consensual disclosure of personal information themselves. A <a href=""https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2021/jul/12/tamil-nadu-school-education-department-officials-selling-students-data-2328770.html"">report</a> published by The New Indian Express on July 21, 2021, claims that the staff and officers in the Tamil Nadu Education Department headquarters and in education departments across the state have been selling the personal information of Class X and Class XII students to colleges. Allegedly, a district education department official charged 2 rupees for each student’s mobile number. Similarly, <a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/data-of-school-students-being-sold-for-rs2-5-per-head/articleshow/74071127.cms"">The Times of India</a> has reported that the administrative staff of schools in Nagpur are now charging anywhere between 2 rupees to 5 rupees per student’s personal data disclosure.
</p>
<h3>Concerns on the Data Breach</h3>
<p>October 25, 2015, FirstPost, in a <a href=""https://www.firstpost.com/india/hyderabad-sex-predator-uses-exam-data-to-trap-sexually-exploit-and-blackmail-girls-2481548.html#:~:text=India-,Hyderabad%3A%20Sex%20predator%20uses%20exam%20data%20to%20trap%2C%20sexually%20exploit,Meticulousness.&amp;text=He%20began%20by%20downloading%20the,and%20Osmania%20University%20PG%20examinations."">report</a>, highlighted how sexual predators, on procuring children’s sensitive information such as their names and contact details - which was freely available on a university’s website - began to contact and lure them under the guise of offering career advice. In the current situation, similar possibilities of the critical misuse of examination data to commit such heinous acts cannot be ruled out, as students' personal information has been compromised by the aforementioned websites, vendors and officials. Similarly, in <a href=""https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2021/jul/12/tamil-nadu-school-education-department-officials-selling-students-data-2328770.html"">an interview</a> conducted by The New Indian Express, a technology expert highlighted that in instances of such data breaches, there is a possibility of students’ contact numbers being uploaded on pornographic websites.
</p>
<p>From a legal perspective, this data breach violates the students’ fundamental right to privacy, as upheld by the Supreme Court in <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/127517806/""><em>K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India</em></a> (2019) 1 SCC 1. Significantly, the decision highlighted the need to secure children’s right to privacy, bearing in mind that minors lack the legal capacity to give consent. Additionally, the Government of India, in 2005, had <a href=""http://164.100.86.208/NCPCR.pdf"">accepted two Optional Protocols</a> to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). As a result, India endeavours to protect children from all forms of exploitation and arbitrary or unlawful interference with their privacy. Hence, if necessary measures are not taken to protect the personal information of children, it would stand in violation of the Puttaswamy decision, and UNCRC’s Optional Protocols.
</p>
<p>Section 43A of the <a href=""https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/it_amendment_act2008%20%281%29_0.pdf"">Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008</a>, holds bodies accountable if they fail to implement “reasonable security practices and procedures” when handling sensitive personal data. According to Section 72A of the Act, the websites, school managements and individuals involved in the mass student data breach can be imprisoned for a term of up to three years or/and can be fined up to five lakh rupees. However, considering the “Students Database India” website claims that they have been providing “100% genuine” data of students from every state and Union Territory for the past six years, the legal ramifications in place seem inadequate.
</p>
<p>It is imperative to highlight that the rampant commercialisation of students’ personal information can be attributed to the exponential <a href=""https://issuu.com/educationinternational/docs/2020_eiresearch_gr_commercialisation_privatisation"">growth of ed-tech</a> and remote education amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Bearing this in mind, the motives of the database purchasers go unchecked as hackers, stalkers, scammers and unwanted marketers are now just a few clicks away from accessing a vast number of students’ personal information. This can leave several students vulnerable to fraud and identity theft, as individuals do not frequently change their personal information, especially email addresses and phone numbers.
</p>
<h3>IFF’s Proactive Measures</h3>
<p>Concerned about the potential threats the aforementioned databases pose to the children’s safety and their right to privacy, on July 16, we wrote to twenty-eight State Commissions for the Protection of Child Rights and four Union Territory Commissions for the Protection of Child Rights to raise our grievances. We urged the Commissions to initiate an enquiry on the infringing websites (“Students Database”, “Students Database India”), the vendor (Shastri Nagar Charkya Puri) and the e-commerce platform (Amazon) and to also forward the case to the Magistrate having the jurisdiction to hear the complaint. The Commissions were also advised to frame and implement remedial measures and guidelines to prevent the leakage of students’ personal data henceforth.
</p>
<p>On July 11, 2021, we filed an <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a87UW9T1cbTilMNBKyagkxAGpFtavIYZ/view?usp=sharing"">RTI request</a> with the Ministry of Education’s Department of School Education and Literacy. To our dismay, on July 19, 2021, the Department replied solely to a query on the National Achievement Survey and disposed of our request. The problematic aspects of this reply are twofold. <em>First</em>, this insinuates that the Department has willfully chosen to not disclose the information. <em>Second</em>, even if the non-disclosure of information was not deliberate, it remains concerning as it insinuates that the Department does not have the pertinent information that we sought.
</p>
<p>Similarly, on July 8, 2021, we filed an <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BXBVU6KaOXfUczEU1rHjgH8Tr_1FXKnt/view?usp=sharing"">RTI request</a> with the CBSE. We sought information related to whether the CBSE categorised and stored the students’ personal data. We also enquired about whether the CBSE makes privacy impact assessment reports or issues any Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) vis-a-vis students’ personal information protection. Lastly, on July 11, 2021, we filed an <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/12fvx4NzatCaZkidC6XlxddYBJc7tnoTM/view?usp=sharing"">RTI request</a> with the NCPCR. We inquired if the NCPCR had received any complaints regarding any incidents of students’ personal data breaches. However, we are still awaiting a response from both of the authorities.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The elixir to the grave concerns on students’ data would be the creation of watertight legal provisions and policies to prohibit such data breaches. This opinion was shared by UNICEF in its <a href=""https://www.unicef.org/about/annualreport/files/India_2016_COAR.pdf"">report</a> which highlighted the vulnerability of Indian children vis-a-vis data breaches. UNICEF also urged the government to enact stringent laws to tackle the menace of cybercrimes and secure children’s right to privacy. While the <a href=""http://164.100.47.4/BillsTexts/LSBillTexts/Asintroduced/373_2019_LS_Eng.pdf"">Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019</a> is a welcome step towards data governance, it still falls short on several accounts. Our piece titled “<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/why-student-data-should-be-students-data/"">#PrivacyOfThePeople - Why Student Data should be Students’ Data</a>” offers a deep dive into the issues with the proposed law. In sum, the Bill makes no mention of either non-personal data or <a href=""https://www.medianama.com/2020/01/223-pdp-bill-2019-children-protection/"">sensitive personal data</a>. Considering the ubiquity of Indian student databases in the market, the possibility of students’ non-personal or sensitive personal data disclosure seems inevitable. In addition, unlike the comprehensive <a href=""https://gdpr-info.eu/"">General Data Protection Regulation</a> and <a href=""https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=afdaf9b50882b7c923a6007dad94f0af&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt34.1.99&amp;rgn=div5"">Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, 1974</a>, the Bill does not discuss data security practices at length.
</p>
<p>From a policy perspective, it is essential for Commissions and government bodies to work proactively to combat such data breaches. This includes ensuring data brokers and commercial entities adopt sustainable data security practices. Taking a leaf from the <a href=""https://www.worldprivacyforum.org/2020/04/without-consent/#footnote-062"">World Privacy Forum report</a>, government agencies also ought to mandate educational institutions to conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment. Additionally, it is imperative to thwart the corrupt practices of government officials. Hence, governments on both - the state and national levels - must set up mechanisms to ensure accountability and transparency of education departments and school managements. To conclude, in light of students’ privacy and personal data being at stake, there is an imperative need to overhaul both - the legal and policy frameworks - to realise child rights in the digital age.</p>

13508,"State Governments need to step up on the Pegasus issue",state-governments-need-to-step-up-on-the-pegasus-issue,,,admin,2021-07-29,,Yes,live,"Anushka Jain, Rohin Garg","<h3>tl;dr</h3>
<p>On July 18, 2021, we came to know about the widespread use of NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware against Indian citizens. However, this is not the first time. In 2019, similar reports came out which detailed how activists and lawyers in Maharashtra &amp; Chhattisgarh were targeted through the spyware. Cognisant of the legal injuries as well as the violations of fundamental rights that have occurred, we wrote to the state governments of Maharashtra &amp; Chhattisgarh to institute investigations into the use of spyware against citizens.
</p>
<h3>What happened in 2019?</h3>
<p>In 2019, it was <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/statement-scary-disclosures-on-use-of-nso-spyware-in-india-signal-a-need-for-urgent-remedy/"">reported</a> that Pegasus, developed by an Israeli firm known as the NSO Group, was used to target the WhatsApp applications of 121 Indian citizens out of which 20 were successfully hacked. Out of the 20 Indian citizens who were successfully targeted through the spying software, a significant number were mainly residing in the states of Maharashtra &amp; Chhattisgarh. The Pegasus hack was first brought to light by Citizen Lab which is an interdisciplinary laboratory based at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, Canada which was conducting research on the use of spyware supplied to government vendors and intelligence agencies by the NSO Group.
</p>
<p>India’s involvement in this enormous breach was first found in the report put out by Citizen Lab on September 18, 2019. This explainer report demonstrated the various countries affected by the Pegasus software and also explained its functioning. In India, the report shows that a distinct Pegasus system was used to target various Internet Service Providers in India including Bharti Airtel and MTNL among others. On May 14, 2019, an article published in the Financial Times for the first time reported that WhatsApp, “discovered that attackers were able to install surveillance software on both iPhones and Android phones by ringing up targets using the app’s phone call function.” As per a statement by WhatsApp, this vulnerability was patched and closed. On October 30, 2019, Indian Express published a report containing statements made by WhatsApp which confirmed that the victims of the hack were mostly Indian journalists and human rights activists.
</p>
<p>Following these revelations, we had <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/the-need-to-investigate-the-nso-group-which-was-behind-the-pegasus-software-is-now-more-than-ever/"">written</a> to the respective state governments in April 2020 as well asking them to institute investigations. However, our requests were not heard.
</p>
<h3>The Pegasus saga continues in 2021</h3>
<p>It was reported in <a href=""https://thewire.in/government/project-pegasus-journalists-ministers-activists-phones-spying"">The Wire dated July 18, 2021</a> that “a leaked database of thousands of telephone numbers believed to have been listed by multiple government clients of an Israeli surveillance technology firm includes over 300 verified Indian mobile telephone numbers, including those used by ministers, opposition leaders, journalists, the legal community, businessmen, government officials, scientists, rights activists and others”.
</p>
<p>The report also detailed that since 2019, NSO has been able to advance Pegasus’ developments to the extent that now Pegasus spyware infections can be achieved through so-called “zero-click” attacks, which do not require any interaction from the phone’s owner in order to succeed. Once Pegasus has been installed in the mobile device, it can harvest SMS messages, address books, call history, calendars, emails and internet browsing histories as well as gain access to and extract any files on the device.
</p>
<p>As we have said in our <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/iffs-statement-on-hacking-revelations-made-by-the-pegasus-project/"">statement</a> regarding the Pegasus revelations, no such power to hack the phones of Indian citizens exists under Indian law, and the pre-existing surveillance powers available under the Telegraph Act, 1885 and the Information Technology Act, 2000 do not permit the installation of spyware or hacking mobile devices. Hacking of computer resources, including mobile phones and apps, is in fact a criminal offence under the Information Technology Act, 2000 and it is only through such hacking that the Pegasus spyware can be used against a person.
</p>
<p>Surveillance such as this which was carried out by NSO through its Pegasus software puts the personal privacy of citizens at risk. The risk is especially to informational privacy which was one of the major focuses of the landmark decision in <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/91938676/""><em>Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India</em> (2017) 10 SCC 1</a> which affirms the fundamental right to privacy. The Hon’ble Justice Chandrachud in this decision focuses on the informational aspect of privacy and its connection with human dignity and autonomy. The decision recognizes informational privacy which reflects an interest in preventing information about the self from being disseminated, and controlling the extent of access to information as one of the facets of the right to privacy.
</p>
<h3>We wrote to the state governments asking them to do their duty to protect their citizens</h3>
<p>As an organisation deeply concerned with the protection of fundamental rights, we wrote to the state governments of <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sJOoTxmDqubx5nvb-uOsF1XuGN7OIgfD/view?usp=sharing"">Maharashtra</a> and <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cgi2v4hklGthpxg0Rv_Mp-i6R0g6J53N/view?usp=sharing"">Chhattisgarh</a> with a few suggestions:
</p>
<ol><li>We recommended that the state governments of Maharashtra &amp; Chhattisgarh should establish an investigation committee to look into the hack committed in their state.
</li><li>The Committee should have a fixed timeline in which to complete its investigation and submit its report to the state government.
</li><li>The Committee should allow for the victims (or legal counsel on their behalf) of the hack to testify before it.
</li><li>The Committee should allow experts in the field of data privacy to testify before it.
</li><li>The Committee should facilitate the registration of open FIRs and encourage that investigations are commenced immediately.
</li><li>The Committee should operate in a transparent manner.
</li></ol><p>This issue does not exist as only a matter of legality; a serious crime has been committed against the Indian citizens that requires immediate action. IFF will continue to fight for transparency, accountability, and justice on this issue!

13509,"Women’s safety on the internet has to account for intersectionality",womens-safety-on-the-internet-has-to-account-for-intersectionality,,,admin,2021-07-19,,Yes,live,"Anushka Jain, Yashaswini Basu","<h2>tl;dr</h2>
<p>In the beginning of July, 2021, the internet was horrified after we came across an application hosted on GitHub which shared the photographs and social media handles of women belonging to the Muslim community in the country without their consent to purportedly “auction” them off. In this post, we outline the steps we have taken to ensure and promote women’s safety and security on the internet in light of this incident.
</p>
<h2>What happened?</h2>
<p>On July 4, 2021, multiple Twitter accounts posted the screengrab from an application hosted on GitHub titled, “Sulli Deals”. The application shared the photographs and social media handles of more than 80 women belonging to the Muslim community in India. The application showcased the information of the women in a way that the user could “claim a ‘sulli”, which is a derogatory term used by right-wing trolls in India for Muslim women, as the “deal of the day”. The aim of the application was to objectify and demean the targeted women by allowing them to be auctioned for sale to the users of the application.
</p>
<p><br />As a result of the public outcry against the application, GitHub removed the application. The <a href=""https://www.freepressjournal.in/india/national-commission-for-women-takes-suo-moto-cognisance-after-photos-of-muslim-women-uploaded-on-sulli-deal-app"">National Commission for Women</a> took suo motu cognisance of the incident and asked the Delhi Police to file FIRs against the perpetrators as well as to submit an action taken report within ten days. Additionally, the <a href=""https://www.freepressjournal.in/india/national-commission-for-women-takes-suo-moto-cognisance-after-photos-of-muslim-women-uploaded-on-sulli-deal-app"">Delhi Commission for Women</a> also issued notice to the Delhi Police on the incident and asked for a detailed action taken report. Subsequently, the <a href=""https://thewire.in/women/sulli-deals-github-delhi-police-fir"">Cyber Cell of Delhi Police registered FIRs under S. 354-A of the Indian Penal Code</a> which relates to sexual harassment. Additionally, one of the targeted women, Pilot Hana Khan, also <a href=""https://twitter.com/girlpilot_/status/1412724267041509383?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1412724267041509383%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthewire.in%2Fwomen%2Fsulli-deals-github-delhi-police-fir"">filed a FIR</a> with the Delhi Police under S. 509 of the IPC which relates to acts intended to insult the modesty of a woman and S. 66 &amp; 67 of the Information Technology Act which relates to hacking and publishing of obscene information in electronic form respectively.
</p>
<p><br />However, according to an <a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com/AsiyaSiddiqui69/status/1413027802513698819"">update</a> posted on Twitter, there is a new domain which has been registered, but not yet hosted, on GoDaddy.com titled, “sullidealing.co.in”.
</p>
<h2>The relevant authorities have failed to identify the actual issue</h2>
<p>While indeed these are relevant provisions, we feel they fail to adequately address the nature of the crime in the current incident. The application categorically targeted women belonging to the Muslim community and therefore, this is not only an act of gender based harassment but also an instance of targeting on the basis of religion. The application targeted these women specifically because of their religious identity as the aim of the application was not just to sexually harass women but to also demean Muslim women and their community by objectifying them and reducing them to “auction items”. This is evident from the fact that the application title itself contains a derogatory slang term used to denote Muslim women specifically and not just women in general. Therefore, we are of the view that while the provisions related to sexual harassment, insult to the modesty of a woman and publication of obscene information are relevant here, this investigation is incomplete unless and until the Delhi Police as well as the NCW &amp; the DCW take cognisance of the fact that this incident was religiously motivated.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, we feel it is exigent that the concerned investigative agencies charge the accused(s) under the following provisions, in addition to the aforementioned provisions:
</p>
<ol><li>Section 153 A of the IPC which punishes any “persons who indulge in wanton vilification or attacks upon the religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc of any particular group or class or upon the founders and prophets of a religion.”
</li><li>Section 295 A of the IPC which penalises “deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage reli­gious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or reli­gious beliefs”.
</li><li>Section 298 of the IPC which punishes anyone who “with the deliberate intention of wounding the religious feelings of any person, utters any word or makes any sound in the hearing of that person or makes any gesture in the sight of that person or places, any object in the sight of that person.”<br /></li></ol><h2>Our concerns</h2>
<p>We are concerned that such incidents will adversely impact the constitutional rights and personal safety of the internet users who might continue to be subjected to harassment through the similar websites &amp; applications and inflict serious threats to the privacy and safety of those targeted on the basis of their religion and gender.<br /></p>
<ol><li><strong>Displaying sensitive information without consent to intimidate and/or harass women is violative of Art. 21 of the Indian Constitution</strong>: The application conducted a “auction” of the targeted Muslim women for over 20 days, by using sensitive information like the photographs and social media handles of the women. Needless to say, these “deals” elicited lewd, perverse and horrifying comments from a vast number of users. While there was no actual auction of any human being, the main goal of this application was to dehumanise and intimidate women who were targeted. This has affected the personal safety and security of those targeted, thus violating their constitutional right to life, guaranteed under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, and has undermined their right to privacy, deemed an integral component of the “right to life” by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India’s decision in <em>KS Puttaswamy v. Union of India</em> (2017) 10 SCC 1.<br /></li><li><strong>Doxxing and online harassment of women infringes upon the freedom of speech and expression of women</strong>: Social media platforms are the town halls of our modern times. Yet, the persistent incidents of sexual harassment and doxxing have made these platforms highly unsafe and toxic for women, ultimately leading them to disengage from social media altogether after facing harassment. According to a study conducted by Plan International, one in every five young women have opted out of social media after being targeted or harassed. The abuses are further aggravated in cases of women who voice their opinions as well as those women who belong to minority communities on social media platforms and in turn, dissuade them from expressing themselves without any fear or inhibitions. This squarely violates the women’s right to freedom of speech and expression enshrined in Article 19(1) of the Indian Constitution.<br /></li><li><strong>Delayed response to curb the spread of such vitriolic information undermines the digital security of women online</strong>: With no overarching data protection legislation in India, your terms of service lack the obligation to protect the data collected or govern the sharing of such sensitive information, within the purview of purpose limitation and exacerbates the privacy and security threats. Further, in the absence of any narrowly defined safeguards against data breach, practices of doxxing and online sexual harassment can continue with impunity. Moreover, the failure of the law enforcement bodies to initiate any prompt action is likely to cause a loss of deterrence for similar miscreants.
</li><li><strong>Instances of online harassment has vitiated the experience of internet use for women all across the world</strong>: According to a survey of more than 8,000 respondents undertaken by the <a href=""https://webfoundation.org/2020/03/the-online-crisis-facing-women-and-girls-threatens-global-progress-on-gender-equality/"">Web Foundation</a>, “half of young women and girls in the global survey have experienced online abuse, including threatening messages, sexual harassment and the sharing of private photos and videos without permission”.
</li></ol><h2>What did we do?</h2>
<p>Horrified by this incident and aware of the rights violations that have taken place we have:
</p>
<ol><li>Sent a representation to GoDaddy.com asking them to immediately rescind the registration of the domain in question.
</li><li>Sent representations to the NCW and the DCW asking them to take cognisance of the fact that the incident in question is religiously motivated and to ensure that all investigations reflect this factor.

<p>Among several other controversies that have surrounded the Government’s COVID-19 vaccine management policies, <a href=""https://theprint.in/health/modi-govt-now-plans-a-touchless-vaccination-process-with-aadhaar-based-facial-recognition/634719/"">recent news</a> about the Government deploying facial recognition facilities at vaccination centres for the purposes of authentication has emerged as a cause of worry. We filed an <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A4EdPASVkdL30kvcAsimuyM47T4MU7n2/view?usp=sharing"">RTI application</a> with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) on May 18, 2021 to understand more about the process and to verify the authenticity of such reports. In their <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A4EdPASVkdL30kvcAsimuyM47T4MU7n2/view?usp=sharing"">reply</a> to our RTI application dated June 24, 2021 the Ministry confirmed the use of facial recognition for verification of beneficiaries of the COVID-19 vaccines but failed to provide any guidelines or SOP that clearly delineates the technical and implementation details of facial recognition technology (FRT) for COVID-19 vaccine verification.<br /></p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Government had implied its plans to roll out <a href=""https://theprint.in/health/modi-govt-now-plans-a-touchless-vaccination-process-with-aadhaar-based-facial-recognition/634719/"">Aadhaar based facial recognition technology</a> (FRT) as the mode of verification of the personal data of the beneficiaries of the COVID-19 vaccines purportedly to make the vaccination process “touchless”, thus replacing the existing practice of biometric verification at vaccination centres through fingerprints and iris scans. This indicates that using Aadhaar cards for the purposes of registration for COVID-19 vaccines can potentially become mandatory, thereby posing grave threats to the privacy and other constitutional rights of the citizens.
</p>
<p>Despite <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aadhaar-not-mandatory-for-covid-19-treatment-and-vaccine-centre-101621099624651.html"">official statements </a>of government authorities affirming that biometric authentication for vaccination was not currently in practice as well as the <a href=""https://indianexpress.com/article/india/aadhaar-not-mandatory-for-registration-on-co-win-portal-union-mos-health-choubey-7177494/"">clarification </a>of the MoHFW in the Lok Sabha that Aadhaar was not mandatory for vaccine registration and several other IDs were accepted for the registration process, this unchecked roll-out of FRT based registration system has caused anxiety and apprehension among many.<br /></p>
<h3>We filed an RTI application asking the MoHFW to furnish details about the use of FRT</h3>
<p>In our <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/internet-freedom-foundation-rti-report-government-use-of-facial-recognition-technology-in-airports-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccination-101620276808052.html"">RTI application</a> with the MoHFW dated May 18, 2021, we had sought information about but not limited to:
</p>
<ol><li>the legislation or rule which authorised the use of FRT for COVID-19 vaccine registration;
</li><li>the specific technology procured for the use of FRT based authentication;
</li><li>the details about the storage and use of the data thus collected;
</li><li>whether any privacy impact assessment was conducted before deploying FRT for vaccine registrations;
</li><li>copies of any guidelines or SOPs which outlined the use of FRT for the registration process and other relevant information.
</li></ol><p>You can peruse all of the questions that we asked by taking a look at a copy of the RTI application <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kcfjE1kSBw4sYIV_eGnzN3mBhVjG_5Gv/view?usp=sharing"">here.</a>
</p>
<h3>MoHFW confirmed that FRT is being used as a part of the vaccination process</h3>
<p>In <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/13eYYZZpOXM4xSI67pBS-g73o4IO9er7H/view?usp=sharing"">response</a> to our RTI application on June 24, 2021, MoHFW acknowledged the use of FRT as one of the methods for online verification of the beneficiaries. They further stated that the images captured through FRT would be sent to UIDAI for verification and not stored in any distinct database. According to their reply, no additional procurement was made for the implementation of FRT based verification. They also informed us that a pilot project for facial recognition authentication is still under continuation. According to <a href=""https://thewire.in/rights/covid-19-vaccination-facial-recognition-technology-aadhaar-vaccine"">reports</a>, this pilot project is being conducted in Jharkhand.
</p>
<p>However, MoHFW failed to specify any legislative or legal order that authorised the use of FRT nor could they provide copies of any relevant privacy impact assessment. Furthermore, the reply stated that use of FRT for verification of the beneficiaries’ data would be according to the terms furnished in the ‘Verifier &amp; Vaccinator Module User Manual’ included in the COWIN portal which was not available on COWIN portal or any open source webpage. Lastly, they were unable to provide us with any information related to the accuracy of the FRT used, any third party assessments which may have been conducted and the exhaustive list of databases with which the facial recognition technology will be linked in order to identify individuals.
</p>
<p>While we appreciate MoHFW conferring this response, we are afraid that they have failed to supply accurate information and have been evasive in their response. This is highly disconcerting since it violates the tenet of transparency under the RTI Act, creates further ambiguity regarding the registration process and offsets the promise of a universal and inclusive vaccination policy which indeed is the crying need of the hour.
</p>
<h3>FRT based verification for vaccination should be stopped</h3>
<p>The COVID-19 vaccines are essential, life saving commodities in the current pandemic and ensuring equitable &amp; indiscriminate access to the vaccines for all is of paramount importance. However, deploying Aadhaar based FRT for the verification process, deprives the citizens who do not possess or have not linked their Aadhaar cards to the COWIN portal or the on-site register, of the vital vaccines. Further, there is <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/from-investigation-to-conviction-how-does-the-police-use-frt/"">evidence</a> that FRT is highly error prone and as may be gleaned from MoHFW’s response, no clearly defined testing or legal vetting was done prior to the deployment. Consequently, <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/sign-on-and-support-close-to-10-organisations-and-158-individuals-who-are-warning-against-aadhaar-based-facial-recognition-for-vaccination/"">the risk of FRT failing to correctly identify the beneficiaries</a> and thereby potentially excluding a significant portion of the population from the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccines, looms large.
</p>
<p>MoHFW informed us that no privacy impact assessment of the use of FRT was conducted prior to its deployment. We have already enunciated the privacy concerns related to the data collected by UIDAI through Aadhar.
</p>
<h3>Use of FRT in vaccine registration process borders on <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IVrtoMvM5FS-mGLYbuQPa3YkJr5OICmq/view"">function creep</a></h3>
<p>In the past, there have been numerous incidents wherein FRTs deployed for a specific reason have been utilised for purposes beyond its original mandate. Thus fears of using the data procured through the FRT in vaccination for larger surveillance would not be unfounded. This is further aggravated by the fact that the User Manual mentioned by MoHFW in their reply to our RTI is not publicly available. This creates further confusion and anxiety regarding how the data would be collected, stored and used by the government authorities.
</p>
<p>Imposing arbitrary requirements of enrolment with inaccurate and exclusionary digital identification schemes without any privacy safeguards is highly problematic and can adversely impact India’s fight against COVID-19.

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have <a href=""https://twitter.com/UnderTheBreach/status/1378314424239460352"">reported</a> that the personal data of 50 crore plus Facebook users, which includes over 60 Lakh Indian Facebook users, is available on the internet for free. This is yet another data breach in a series of data breaches. We have ourselves <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/security-incidents-and-the-personal-data-protection-bill/"">addressed</a> several such breaches in the past, and this is the <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/mobikwik-data-breach/"">second such post</a> only in the last fortnight. In this post, we discuss the steps you can take if your data has been compromised because of the breach. We also discuss the steps we take to ensure the security of your data over the internet. One of the steps we take is raising digital rights concerns with competent authorities. To address the concerns of Indian Facebook-users affected by the data breach, we have <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_gVNQiv4L4MXnMuoUu7NwUm8RHpZlDxI/view?usp=sharing"">written</a> to the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-IN), asking them to initiate an inquiry over the breach under Section 70B(6) of the Information Technology Act, 2000.
</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>On 31st March 2021, we <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/mobikwik-data-breach/"">provided details</a> of the data breach of Indian MobiKwik users and pointed out five steps we expected MobiKwik to take to alleviate the situation. On 3rd April 2021, information on another significant data leak surfaced. The leaked data pertains to information on users collected by Facebook as a pre-condition to avail its services. Vice had first <a href=""https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgz7bd/facebook-phone-numbers-bot-telegram"">reported</a> this leak in January 2021, stating that a bot was selling data of 500 million plus Facebook users.<br /><br />Now, a cybersecurity researcher has revealed that the data of these 50 crores plus Facebook users, which includes over <a href=""https://twitter.com/UnderTheBreach/status/1349674272227266563"">60 Lakh Indian Facebook users</a>, is available on the internet for free. The data contains sensitive information of users such as phone number, Facebook ID, location, past locations, birthdate, email address and relationship status. This data breach violates the privacy of lakhs of Indians and puts them at risk of various kinds of frauds including identity theft. These are real risks that put millions of Indian to risk of potential cyber criminals and online scams.
</p>
<h3>Facebook’s response</h3>
<p>Facebook has not informed the users whose privacy has been compromised. Facebook has instead <a href=""https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/facts-on-news-reports-about-facebook-data/"">claimed</a> that the data is from 2019 and that it had fixed the issue back then. However, even if the data is from 2019, the breach is still concerning because individuals do not change their personal information, especially email addresses and phone numbers, over such a short period. Also, this breach speaks to fairly weak cyber security practices by a large silicon valley company that literally has billions of dollars in revenue. This demands a more thoughtful and considerate approach by them. They should notify users whenever a breach takes place and also a review of it’s policy by which it seeks large amounts of information including the phone numbers of its users. We also have reason to be circumspect, as if we go by the logic of the explanation, <a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-data-leak-500-million-users-phone-numbers/"">Facebook despite being aware of the data breach since 2019 did not inform users</a>. Facebook needs to do better starting now!
</p>
<h3>How can you respond to the breach?</h3>
<p>We have reviewed advice from several cyber security experts and also hope to provide you with actionable advice on what you can do to mitigate the risks which emerge from data breaches. Please exercise your own judgement, because by all means, we are not perfect and such personal decisions must be made only after reflection of your risk levels, independent study and research.<br /><br />For one, you need to get better invested with the emerging policy and laws around data breaches. For instance there is no clear legal requirement that is triggered on a data breach for your right to know if you have been affected by the breach. This is difficult because Facebook has not yet informed users. Moreover, as we highlighted <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/security-incidents-and-the-personal-data-protection-bill/"">here</a>, the law as it stands and the proposed Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (PDPB, 2019) do not even require Facebook to inform users whose privacy has been violated.<br /><br />Second, while laws may not be very helpful, to overcome this information asymmetry, you can use either haveibeenpwned and, “Safe me”. We think these solutions are relatively safe but ask you to exercise independent judgement. <a href=""https://haveibeenpwned.com/"">Haveibeenpwned</a> is a free to use website where users can learn whether their accounts have been compromised. The website does this by aggregating information from data breaches, and you can check out more information on its functionality - <a href=""https://www.troyhunt.com/tag/have-i-been-pwned-3f/"">here</a>. “Safe me” is an app that is available over <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lucideus.safeme_serverless_android&amp;hl=en_IN&amp;gl=US"">android</a> and <a href=""https://apps.apple.com/us/app/safe-me-by-lucideus/id1498885997"">IOS</a>, and it assesses the cyberisk of a user on a scale of 1 to 5. Interestingly, the app has certain courses which one can take to improve their ‘safety score’.<br /><br />Third, once you find out that your Facebook data has been compromised and if you want to avoid such a situation again, the best option is to delete your Facebook account. However, most of us cannot afford to do so because of the sheer market dominance of Facebook. It is a <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/04/553000000-reasons-not-let-facebook-make-decisions-about-your-privacy"">hostage situation</a> - all our friends, families and colleagues are on Facebook. If Facebook permitted <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/07/facing-facebook-data-portability-and-interoperability-are-anti-monopoly-medicine"">interoperability</a>, we could have interacted with our connections who are on Facebook through a more secure social networking website. Since this is not the case, <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2021/04/06/facebook-data-breach-heres-what-to-do-now/?sh=fe2f8ab57082"">experts suggest</a> that affected users should change their passwords immediately and <a href=""https://www.lifewire.com/steps-to-make-facebook-private-2654416"">consider removing information</a> that does not ‘need’ to be on Facebook.<br /><br />A word of caution - such responses are a bandage on a bullet hole. To prevent such breaches, we need structural changes that ensure that such breaches do not even occur. If they do, data processors such as Facebook in this case, act in a responsible manner. This is why we engage with the development of the Data Protection and cyber security laws. Currently, we have been analysing PDPB, 2019 through a <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/startfromscratch-the-data-bill-series-part-1/"">four-part series</a> and we have previously critiqued <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/facebook-human-rights-policy/"">Facebook’s Human Rights Polic</a>y and <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/explainer-whatsapp-privacy-policy-changes-2021/"">WhatsApp’s privacy policy</a>.
</p>
<h3>How are we raising this issue?</h3>
<p>Apart from the above, to address this massive data breach of Indian Facebook users, we have addressed a <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_gVNQiv4L4MXnMuoUu7NwUm8RHpZlDxI/view?usp=sharing"">letter</a> to CERT-IN. CERT-IN is responsible for collecting, analysing, and disseminating information on cyber incidents and undertaking measures to handle cybersecurity incidents.<br /><br />We had <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cXXVX2qqqCx0SRo8DuoZHa4wFM682-c8/view?usp=sharing"">written</a> to CERT-IN even after the MobiKwik breach and are thankful to them for acknowledging our request. The agency had assured us that it would take appropriate action. In this letter, we have highlighted the concerns we have raised above and requested CERT-IN to inquire into the data breach of Indian Facebook users. We have also asked CERT-IN to call upon Facebook to explain why such a breach took place, examine the period from which the data pertains and publicly disclose its steps to remedy the situation. We are hopeful that an enquiry by CERT-IN will make Facebook provide relief to the affected users.<br /><br />We will continue to follow-up and assist CERT-IN regarding both the data breaches that have come to light in the past few days.

<p>As the final piece in our series on the Data Protection Bill, we look at alternative paradigms of data protection. Here, we first explain the 7 fundamental principles of the Indian Privacy Code, 2018. Then we analyse two alternative data protection bills that were introduced in Parliament: the Data (Privacy and Protection) Bill, 2017 and the Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019.
</p>
<h3>A quick recap</h3>
<p><a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/startfromscratch-the-data-bill-series-part-1/"">Part 1</a> of our series dealt with the need for a data protection bill, and illustrated emerging threats that threaten our modern digital life. We also provided some historical context for the Bill, and gave some updates on what the future lies with respect to the report of the joint Parliamentary Committee on the Bill.
</p>
<p>Then came <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/startfromscratch-an-explainer-on-the-personal-data-protection-bill-2019/"">Part 2</a>, in which we explained the various provisions of the Bill. We began with an explanation of all the definitions and jargon, and then showed how the Bill:
</p>
<ul><li>provides users with certain Rights;
</li><li>lays down a consent mechanism for the processing of personal data;
</li><li>imposes on obligations on data collectors and processors
</li><li>lays down transparency and accountability measures to be followed
</li><li>provides the government with certain exemptions
</li></ul><p>We also provided an update on the Bill: the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Personal Data Protection Bill will <a href=""http://loksabhaph.nic.in/Business/UserBulletin1.aspx"">now be releasing its report in the first week of the monsoon session</a>.
</p>
<p>Then last week, in <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/why-is-the-data-bill-being-criticized/"">part 3</a>, we highlighted the key concerns with the Bill that we feel deserved the most attention. Broadly, we covered the following issues: the dilution of user’s rights, non-consensual processing of data, definitional ambiguities, the removal of anonymity on social media, the threat of increased surveillance, the lack of independence of the Data Protection Authority, and governmental access to non-personal data.
</p>
<p>This post will be the last in our #StartfromScratch series, and we plan to use this to provide examples of what other potential data protection frameworks might look like. Now, the <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/127517806/""><em>Puttaswamy</em> judgment of the Supreme Court</a>, which enshrined the Right to Privacy as a fundamental right, noted that a data protection bill signals a positive obligation of the Government of India towards fulfilling the autonomy and dignity of the people by securing informational privacy. Hence, any data protection legislation needs to be centred around our fundamental rights. The bill must cement the power of individuals and communities that constitute individuals over governments and corporations.
</p>
<p>For instance, the Government of India is under a clear obligation to provide essential services. However, the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 is ambiguous about whether services may be denied due to a lack of consent for the processing of personal data. Another example is the use of surveillance technology.
</p>
<p>Today, such technologies are no longer about the surveillance of the high and the mighty - they are now used for a more everyday surveillance in which the <em>aam aadmi</em> is constantly surveilled in public spaces and while using public infrastructure. Facial surveillance even occurs through masks in metropolitan areas. Such technologies are not adequately regulated under the Personal Data Protection Bill, under which there are exemptions for large categories of surveillance which do not have any oversight mechanisms of judicial review, a hallmark of a democratic country. Furthermore, existing models of data protection, as well as a lot of the conversation that occurs around the bill, focus more on the growth of the digital economy, rather than the protection of an individual’s privacy. We believe that any rights respecting legislation should not drive a bargain between the market and fundamental rights.
</p>
<p>With this in mind, we will now explain the <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/principles"">7 privacy principles</a> of the <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/bill"">India Privacy Code, 2018</a>, put forth and discussed by lawyers involved in the <em>Puttaswamy </em>case and by public law experts. We believe that these principles must form the bedrock of any forthcoming data protection legislation.
</p>
<h3>The 7 Privacy Principles of #SaveOurPrivacy</h3>
<p>These Principles were created through a collaborative and iterative process by a diverse group of civil society organisations, lawyers involved in cases and submissions related to digital rights, and digital law experts. They draw from a variety of sources, including the <a href=""https://cis-india.org/internet-governance/blog/privacy-protection-bill-2013-citizens-draft"">Privacy (Protection) Bill, 2013</a>, the report of the <a href=""http://planningcommission.nic.in/reports/genrep/rep_privacy.pdf"">Justice A.P. Shah Committee of Experts</a>, and submissions by multiple lawyers to the <a href=""http://privacyisaright.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Detailed-Answers-to-the-Justice-Srikrishna-Committee-White-Paper-1.pdf"">Justice Srikrishna Committee of Experts</a>, as well as various Supreme Court judgements such as the <em>Puttaswamy</em> judgement. Best practices from international frameworks such as the European Union’s <a href=""https://gdpr-info.eu/"">General Data Protection Regulation</a> were also taken into account:
</p>
<ol><li><strong>Individual rights are at the center of privacy and data protection: </strong>The individual and their rights are primary. The promotion of an individual’s rights promotes innovation in a sustainable way.
</li><li><strong>A data protection law must be based on privacy principles: </strong>User rights as identified by the report of the Justice A.P. Shah Committee of Experts are essential to a data protection law. Additionally, a data protection law should develop with advances in technology and global best practices. Exceptions to the law should be: (a) worded clearly; (b) limited in purpose, necessary and proportionate to the aim; and (c) accompanied by sufficient procedural safeguards.
</li><li><strong><strong>A strong privacy authority must be created to enforce the privacy principles:</strong> </strong>We need a strong and independent body to ensure that the data protection rights are put into practice and enforced. It should be provided wide powers of investigation, adjudication, rule-making and enforcement. The authority should adopt an approach that builds accountability for the rights of users by having powers to impose penalties that are proportionate to the harm and build deterrence, and should serve as a forum for the redressal of the general public’s grievances.
</li><li><strong>The government should respect user privacy: </strong>We support the use of digital technologies for public benefit. However, they should not be privileged over fundamental rights. Individuals cannot be forced to trade away their data and citizenship at the altar of being permitted to use government services and access legal entitlements on welfare. To make sure this happens the privacy authority must have overriding power and superintendence over all legal entities, including the government, in matters of data protection and privacy.
</li><li><strong>A complete privacy code comes with surveillance reform: </strong>Any data protection law has to limit mass surveillance as it contravenes the principles of necessity, proportionality and purpose limitation. Even when individual interception and surveillance is carried out this should be severely limited in substance and practice through procedural safeguards. Furthermore, the privacy authority must be allowed oversight over surveillance activities, while, to ensure accountability, all such orders need to be communicated to the person who was surveilled.
</li><li><strong>The right to information needs to be strengthened and protected: </strong>Individual rights are well served by the Right to Information Act which brings accountability to the functioning of government and public authorities. Hence, privacy protections which already exist under the Right to Information Act and are made subject to public interest, need to be preserved. Information Commissioners should be exempted from interference or control from external authorities.
</li><li><strong>International protections and harmonisation to protect the open internet must be incorporated:</strong> Data protection legislations must have extraterritorial effect and apply to web services and platforms which are accessible in India and which gather personal data of Indians. At the same time, care and caution should be taken to preserve the global character of the open internet which is beneficial to Indians as they can access information, knowledge and services from all over the world.
</li></ol><p>We will now look at two legislations that we believe further the process started by the privacy principles.
</p>
<h3>The Data (Privacy and Protection) Bill, 2017</h3>
<p>The <a href=""http://164.100.47.4/billstexts/lsbilltexts/asintroduced/1121.pdf"">Data (Privacy and Protection) Bill, 2017</a> is a variant of the Indian Privacy Code, 2017 was introduced in the Lok Sabha as a private member Bill by Sashi Tharoor MP. The Bill was submitted to the Parliament before the Puttaswamy judgement and the constitution of the Sri Krishna Committee. The Bill is thus inspired by international best practices and the report of the Justice A.P. Shah Committee of Experts.
</p>
<p>The Bill seeks to establish an effective and comprehensive data protection regime in the country <a href=""https://www.deccanherald.com/exclusives/shashi-tharoor-explains-his.html"">to protect the right to privacy of individuals in a data driven world</a>, and <a href=""https://www.deccanherald.com/exclusives/shashi-tharoor-explains-his.html"">shuns the ‘goods and services’ driven perspective on data</a>. At the outset, the Bill sets down the guiding principles by enumerating the core data protection principles that are embedded in the Bill and those that govern the Bill. Individuals are made the owners of and put in control of their personal data. The Bill acknowledges that the Government is one of the biggest collectors of personal data and makes it a point to bring the State under its purview to plug misuse by the State. The main regulatory body envisaged is an independent privacy commission. The Bill has various provisions to secure the independence and accountability of its regulatory body and to prevent it from being reduced to a paper tiger. Given that the Bill was drafted before the Puttaswamy judgement, it stands out for being the first statute to explicitly declare that right to privacy is a fundamental right, which is essential to the maintenance of a democratic society. 
</p>
<p>User consent forms the bedrock for data processing under this Bill. The collection and processing of personal data has to be done with the consent of data subjects. In the event of a data breach, notifications must be sent not just to the Privacy Commissioner, but also to the data subjects affected. Certain types of data such as medical records, financial data, biometrics, sexual preference and practices, political affiliation, etc. have been classified as sensitive personal data and are afforded even more protection by requiring explicit consent for the collection and processing of such data.
</p>
<p>The Bill limits the grounds for the non-consensual processing of data to two cases: a) the use of personal data for personal or family use and b) surveillance by a resident of their own residential property. The limitations on the collection, processing, and storage of personal data are carefully drafted keeping in mind the interest of the data subjects. Indeed, a remarkable feature of the Bill is its focus on the collection of personal data by intelligence agencies, surveillance, and interception of communications. The Bill devotes Chapters IV and V to interception and surveillance respectively. The Bill appears to be mindful of the perils of mass surveillance and bans it outright. Though surveillance at the level of the individual may be allowed, certain safeguards have been placed to ensure that such exemptions do not become a tool to crush dissent. For example, an order of the Chief Privacy Officer is required for carrying out surveillance and interception. Furthemore, any person being surveilled must be informed about such surveillance and the duration thereof.
</p>
<h3>The Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019</h3>
<p>Following the lapse of the Data Privacy and Protection Bill, 2017, another private member Bill; <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DReq96e-FLsSoKUvK94_-VCtu2Y1PE97/view"">The Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019</a> was introduced in the Parliament by Dr. Ravikumar M.P. in 2019. It is another, more updated and robust variant of the is a variant of the Indian Privacy Code, 2017. This Bill was a big step along the path to securing the right to privacy of individuals. This<a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/blog/personal-data-and-information-privacy-code-bill-2019-introduced-in-the-lok-sabha-today-saveourprivacy""> Bill is built around the seven privacy principles</a> under the updated Indian Privacy Code, 2018.
</p>
<p>The Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019, seeks to ensure the protection of informational privacy of individuals through a rights-based individual-centric data protection regime. Like the Data (Privacy and Protection Bill) 2017, this Bill also declares at its outset that every person has a natural right to privacy. The guiding principles of the Bill make it mandatory that personal data be processed fairly and lawfully. These principles also state that any invasion of privacy shall be evaluated based on the principles of legality, necessity and proportionality, and thus enshrines the privacy test laid down in the <em>Puttaswamy</em> judgement. The collection of personal data under the Bill is envisaged through a meaningful, revocable, and accountable notice and consent framework.
</p>
<p>The provisions of the Bill that handle consent are thorough. An important provision on consent under the Bill is that the data controller cannot deny any service to any person for the reason that consent for sharing personal data for identification purposes has not been obtained. Moreover, the data subjects can claim compensation if essential services are denied to them on this ground. This provision has contemporary relevance where Aadhar has become the prerequisite for availing of essential services.
</p>
<p>The Bill confers certain rights to the individuals, such as the right to access personal data, the right to correct their personal data, the right to destruction and erasure of personal data, right to object etc. Among these rights, most remarkable is the right to seek exemption from automated decision making. Individuals can seek exemption from decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling, where such automated decisions cause demonstrable harm or injury.<br />Similar to the 2017 Bill, the grounds for exemption under this Bill are limited as well. Interception and Surveillance are dealt with in detail separately under Chapter IV of the Bill. The safeguards on surveillance and interception under this Bill are almost similar to that in the The Data (Privacy and Protection) Bill, 2017. However, the Bill provides for the setting up of a Surveillance and Interception Review Division, which review, renew, or take any other action with respect to orders for the interception of communications and surveillance.

<p>With cyber threats on the rise, we are trying out something new. It is a cyber security newsletter with a round up of the latest developments in the domain of digital security. The goal of this monthly newsletter is to open a conversation about the digital security crisis India has been undergoing for a few years now and understand why this is an important issue for you to actively start engaging with. Every month I will try to sum up the key cybersec updates you should know about on a national and international scale. If there is something you think I should cover next month, drop me a line at: <a href=""mailto:shivani@internetfreedom.in"">shivani@internetfreedom.in</a>. I’m listening!
</p>
<p>For the first edition of this newsletter, I will cover something that has been in the news for a while now, i.e. the most recent data breaches that have accessed the personal data of millions of Indian users and what that means for us.
</p>
<h3>But first, what do I mean by a digital security crisis/es?</h3>
<p>Consider the following:
</p>
<ul><li>On February 3, 2021, multiple <a href=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/airtel-denies-claims-that-data-of-2-5-million-users-was-leaked/articleshow/80660207.cms"">reports</a> suggested that the data of 2.5 Million Airtel users was compromised in a breach. The leaked data included Airtel customers’ names, phone numbers, DOBs, addresses and Aadhar numbers. Airtel denied that any such breach had occurred and alleged that the data didn’t belong to Airtel customers. However, independent researchers were able to confirm that the leaked data indeed belonged to Airtel subscribers. Their users were not informed of this breach.<br /></li><li>On February 26, 2021 an Indian internet security researcher by the name of Rajshekhar Rajaharia put out a tweet that a massive data breach had put the data of 11 Crore Indian users on sale on the darkweb, allegedly from a company’s server in India. According to the tweet, the KYC details of users were leaked during the breach which included information about their PAN, Aadhar, etc. A little over a month later, on March 29, 2021 news broke that this was the data of Mobikwik’s users. Mobikwik denied any wrongdoing and blamed their users instead. Here’s a useful read if you want to learn about this breach <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/mobikwik-data-breach/"">in detail</a>. Mobikwik’s users were also not informed of this breach.<br /></li><li>In early 2020, a vulnerability that enabled seeing the phone number linked to every Facebook account was exploited, creating a database containing the information of 533m users across countries. On April 3, 2021 it was reported that the data was leaked for free to the world. Security researchers <a href=""https://twitter.com/UnderTheBreach/status/1378314424239460352"">revealed</a> that the personal data of 50+ crore Facebook users was breached, including over 60 Lakh Indian Facebook users. The leaked data includes information of users such as phone numbers, Facebook ID, location, past locations, birthdate, email address and relationship status. Facebook claimed that the data was from 2019 and they had fixed the issue. Their story has<a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-data-leak-500-million-users-phone-numbers/""> a lot of holes</a> but the important thing to note is that regardless of <em>when</em> the breach occurred, Facebook did not inform its users about it.<br /></li></ul><p>This isn’t the first time companies have denied a data breach. In fact, many have gone to great lengths to <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45666280"">cover up</a> such security incidents. Moreover, these are only a few recent, handpicked instances. <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/in-en/signup?formid=urx-46542"">Ponemon’s Cost Of A Data Breach Report 2020</a> (commissioned by IBM) studied breaches in 17 countries (including India). They found a lot of things but here are some of their key findings that might be of interest to you:<br /></p>
<img src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZqnFDi1gxb5bzvMtYRvxgVkMmZFlIdQ6e2_u6PDJ7QjlE61TJR4Gy0-Qjf6MhdakLVBbd-cYErFft3A0K_ii-XKTydC4ZiWbqJ1ZBMwxoNlqwZxI0sPG75NPPJu7q3JQAgdKeehd"" class=""kg-image"" style=""width:480px;"" alt=""ZqnFDi1gxb5bzvMtYRvxgVkMmZFlIdQ6e2_u6PDJ7QjlE61TJR4Gy0-Qjf6MhdakLVBbd-cYErFft3A0K_ii-XKTydC4ZiWbqJ1ZBMwxoNlqwZxI0sPG75NPPJu7q3JQAgdKeehd"" /><p><em>Data from Ponemon’s Cost Of A Data Breach Report 2020</em><br /></p>
<p>According to the bar chart above, Customer PII (Personally Identifiable Information) was the type of most often lost or stolen in breaches. This is exactly the kind of data that was leaked in the aforementioned Mobikwik and Airtel breaches. Whereas, these instances highlight a pattern of impunity with which these companies function, it is also just the tip of the iceberg. Prioritising digital security must become a part of companies and organizations’ formal policies. In a <a href=""https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-96/Accenture-2019-Cost-of-Cybercrime-Study-Final.pdf#zoom=50"">report by Accenture in 2019</a>, (again, by Ponemon and commissioned by Accenture) that studied the Cost of Cybercrime put this across really well:<br /></p>
<p><em>Increases in phishing, ransomware and malicious insider attacks mean that greater emphasis needs to be on nurturing a security-first culture. Accountability is key. Training and education are essential to reinforce safe behaviours, both for people within the organization and across the entire business ecosystem.</em>

<h3>So, is there nothing we can do?</h3>
<p>Yes there is! There’s plenty we can do on our own personal level that will really help amp up your digital security and safeguard you from quite a few, if not all, cybersecurity threats! The goal of today’s post is quite simply to disseminate information and hopefully provide you with some helpful advice on how you can regain control if your PII has been leaked in a breach.
</p>
<ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Firstly, <a href=""https://haveibeenpwned.com/"">find out</a> if you’re amongst the millions of people who’ve had their email or phone information stolen at some point, in some data breach. If the answer is yes, and it will be for 90% of people, please change your passwords everywhere. A much better option here would be to opt for <a href=""https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4041/passphrase"">a passphrase</a> instead of a password since they can be much harder to crack. <br /></li><li><strong>Step 2: </strong>If you use the same password or passphrase everywhere, change them everywhere and set a completely different one for each service (avoid reusing your passwords!). This is helpful because even if your password has been compromised, it still can’t be used by anyone to gain access to your accounts if you’ve already changed your password everywhere. And a really easy way to manage your passwords for different services without having to remember them is to use a <a href=""https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-password-manager/"">password manager</a>. The best passwords are the ones you don’t remember!<br /></li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Lastly, please set <a href=""https://blog.1password.com/how-long-should-my-passwords-be/"">complex passwords</a> and passphrases. You can’t fight big tech and other malicious actors if your password is 12345678. There’s a lot more you can do and we’ll cover a few digisec dos and don'ts as a part of each of these blog posts / newsletters.
</li></ul><p>Amping up your everyday digital hygiene is at the core of protecting your data. Oftentimes, these concepts are accessible only by people who are comfortable using and interacting with technology in their daily lives. In order to bridge that gap, we’ve also started making <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekufPZeHHbg"">digital security videos in Hindi</a>, in an attempt to make these concepts reach a more diverse audience. If you have any ideas on how we can do a better job at reaching more people, please reach out to us. We aim to listen, learn and grow!

<p>On January 21, 2021 we had sent a <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/use-of-facial-recognition-by-cbse-is-an-unnecessary-and-harmful-impediment-for-students/"">representation</a> to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) asking them to cease use of facial recognition technology (FRT) for allowing students to access their digital documents. Prior to this we had also made RTIs seeking further information on this FRT deployment. On April 8, 2021 we received a reply from them however they failed to adequately respond to any of our concerns. Read our analysis of their reply below.
</p>
<h3>Actions to prevent FRT systems on students</h3>
<p>Today there is an <a href=""https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2021/apr/13/covid-19-chorus-grows-louder-for-cancellation-of-class-10-12-board-exams-no-decision-by-cbse-yet-2289668.html"">ongoing conversation</a> on the need to postpone CBSE examination as we see a surge in Covid cases across the country. Here, some proposals have been made for the conduct of these examinations through remote means. This may bring up the worrying prospect of deployment of facial recognition as an authentication technology. We have good reasons to fear such outcomes that may threaten the privacy of students all over India. It connects to our prior work, for which we have several updates to provide you on the basis of responses from CBSE.
</p>
<p>We first became aware that CBSE is using facial recognition technology to provide access to digital documents to students by a <a href=""https://indianexpress.com/article/education/cbse-introduces-facial-recognition-system-for-accessing-digital-documents-cbse-nic-in-6838840/"">news report</a> published in the Indian Express on October 22, 2020. The application enables students to download their digital academic documents of classes 10 &amp; 12 after a live image of the student is matched with the photograph on the CBSE admit card already stored in the repository. Spurred into action from this news report, we filed a Right to Information request with CBSE bearing reference no. CBSED/R/E/20/03761 on October 28, 2020 asking them to provide information about the scope and nature of the project. In its reply dated November 24, 2020 bearing reference no. CBSED/R/E/20/03761/3176, CBSE stated that it was not using facial recognition technology, instead it was using face matching technology, in an attempt to create a measure of difference between the two.
</p>
<p>As a result, we filed another RTI request on December 10, 2020 bearing reference no. CBSED/R/E/20/04158 asking CBSE to explain how the face matching technology operates. In its <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RHPUXJv3LPTp5TxkDXfVOfhlxpy5FnfO/view?usp=sharing"">reply</a> dated January 27, 2021, CBSE failed to respond to our queries satisfactorily. In our request to them we had asked them to share with us a step by step process of the working of the “face matching technique”. However, the reply failed to provide us with any details about how the face matching takes place as well as how it is distinct from facial recognition.
</p>
<p>In addition to filing RTI requests for information on the application, we also sent a <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qCDmelxXeZ5HDim7svgDBkh-kRaKcmc0/view?usp=sharing"">representation</a> to the CBSE dated January 21, 2021. In our representation, <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/use-of-facial-recognition-by-cbse-is-an-unnecessary-and-harmful-impediment-for-students/"">we highlighted</a> our concerns related to privacy and exclusion. In light of these concerns, we recommended that CBSE cease use of facial recognition irrespective of the nomenclature being used for it as face matching for any of its deployments.
</p>
<h3>What did the CBSE say in its reply to our representation?</h3>
<p>In its <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/18GN1ceny92wXHUb8qxjRY23ukAwm93T3/view?usp=sharing"">reply</a> dated April 8, 2021, the CBSE has again reiterated that it is only employing a “face matching technique” and not using FRT. However, CBSE hase once again failed to convey any meaningful distinction between the two processes. We believe that this is just a tactic to dilute the issue through use of confusing nomenclature.
</p>
<p>Then, the reply moves on to responding to our analysis of the program based on the Hon’ble Supreme Court's decision in <em>Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India</em> (2017) 10 SCC 1. While we commend the CBSE for trying to reason within the existing privacy standards as set by the Supreme Court, we find it’s justification to be erroneous for the following reasons.
</p>
<ul><li><strong>Legality</strong>: CBSE asserts that since it does not retain the data collected from the “face matching technique”, it does not need to show legality of the program or the existence of a law which allows them to regulate the program. This understanding is incorrect since the intrusion into the privacy of the students takes place the moment the photograph is uploaded into the facial recognition database. Privacy does not only arise from data at rest, but also when personal data is used for processing. Further, in the absence of any legal basis which mandates non-retention of biometric data under the program, it cannot be proven that no data is being retained since there is no Data Protection Authority to verify such assurances. It is important to consider that such data may also be shared with third parties who may be private organisations, hence verification becomes essential.
</li><li><strong><strong>Proportionality</strong>: </strong>Additionally, the use of FRT by CBSE fails to satisfy the proportionality requirement of <em>Puttaswamy, </em>since, according to the reply sent to us by CBSE, FRT is just one of the authentication mechanisms being used under the multi-factor authentication process in place and is voluntary. Therefore, it is clear that CBSE does have alternatives to the use of FRT which are less invasive to the privacy of students.
</li><li><strong>Procedural guarantees to check against the abuse of State interference</strong>: Finally, there are no procedural guarantees in place to ensure that misuse of the technology does not take place thereby increasing the risks related to its use. The CBSE has only responded in part to how the data is secured against breaches but has failed to respond to how internal misuse will be curbed.
</li></ul><p>Read our full analysis of the program <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/use-of-facial-recognition-by-cbse-is-an-unnecessary-and-harmful-impediment-for-students/"">here</a>.
</p>
<h3>The second wave is a time for care</h3>
<p>We note how the CBSE <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbse-class-10-exams-cancelled-class-12-exams-postponed-says-govt-after-pm-modi-s-covid-review-meet-101618383590781.html"">responded positively</a> accounting for the care of students by cancelling examinations for the 10th standard and deferring those for the 12 standard till June, 2021 as we see a surge in Covid cases across the country. Here, some proposals have been floating for the conduct of these examinations through remote means. This again may bring up the worrying prospect of deployment of facial recognition as an authentication technology. We have good reasons to fear such outcomes that may threaten the privacy of students all over India. It connects to our prior work, for which we have several updates to provide you on the basis of responses from CBSE. We urge the CBSE to consider these risks keeping the welfare and the rights of students in mind. This includes safeguarding them from invasive technologies such as FRT systems.
</p>
<h3>Project Panoptic</h3>
<p>While we thank CBSE for engaging with us on this issue, its responses remain unsatisfactory. At the same time such engagement is a step in the right direction towards improving institutional practices around personal data and sensitive public officials and decision makers against the deployment of FRT systems. Under Project Panoptic, we have been tracking all ongoing use of facial recognition technology in the country.
</p>
<p>What can you do? Add your voice to more than 500 concerned Indians who have called for a complete ban on the use of FRT by the government entities, police and other security/intelligence agencies. Read and sign the petition <a href=""https://panoptic.in/petition"">here</a>!

<p>A sub-committee of the E-Committee of the Supreme Court has released the <a href=""https://ecommitteesci.gov.in/document/draft-vision-document-for-e-courts-project-phase-iii/"">Draft Vision Document of e-Courts Project Phase III</a>. The objective it hopes to achieve is on finalisation to provide a blueprint for the judiciary to adopt and implement digitisation. Since comments on the vision document have been invited by April, 23 we are encouraging feedback by providing a main outline that helps you understand these issues. Our outline notes the obvious positives of transparency and efficiency, while noting some preliminary concerns on data protection, the digital divide and automation of judicial functions. We encourage wide participation not only by lawyers, academics and technologists – but every Indian passionate about improving our justice system.
</p>
<h3>First, how to participate?</h3>

</li><li>Last date: Comments on the document by the <a href=""https://www.mygov.in/group-issue/inviting-suggestions-draft-vision-document-phase-iii-ecourts-project/"">23rd of April</a>.
</li></ul><h3>Massive changes are underway</h3>
<p>We often hear for the need for judicial reforms. But does technology have a role to play in it? In the 21st century, the judiciary continues to operate in the <a href=""https://www.firstpost.com/india/what-ails-indias-courts-crumbling-buildings-poor-infrastructure-cripple-daily-functioning-4456905.html"">brick and mortar</a> (and <a href=""https://www.thequint.com/news/india/indian-judiciary-uses-eleven-billion-papers-in-a-year-a-million-tress-and-hundred-and-nine-billion-litres-of-water"">paper</a>?) world, and suffers from a <a href=""https://www.barandbench.com/news/india-justice-report-on-the-judiciary-average-case-pendency-in-subordinate-courts-is-5-years"">large pendency of cases</a> which have <a href=""https://indianexpress.com/article/india/pandemic-impact-record-pendency-of-cases-at-all-levels-of-judiciary-7247271/"">only increased</a> during the pandemic.
</p>
<p>Last week, as a response to these challenges, significant developments took place at the Supreme Court. First, the Supreme Court E-Committee invited comments on the <a href=""https://ecommitteesci.gov.in/document/draft-vision-document-for-e-courts-project-phase-iii/"">Draft Vision Document of e-Courts Project Phase III</a>. Second, the Chief Justice <a href=""https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/supreme-court-artificial-intelligence-portal-supace-chief-justice-sa-bobde-172220"">launched</a> the Supreme Court Portal for Assistance in Court’s efficiency (SUPACE) which is an AI driven tool designed to assist judges with processing information. Interestingly, SUPACE is not discussed in the draft vision document of e-Courts project Phase III. And third, Justice D.Y Chandrachud, who heads the E-Committee <a href=""https://www.barandbench.com/news/litigation/e-committee-anvil-finalising-rules-live-streaming-court-proceedings-justice-dy-chandrachud"">indicated</a> that it was at the anvil of finalising rules for live streaming of court proceedings across the country. These massive changes will change the interactions of citizens with the judicial branch and it is important we all pay attention, and if possible, participate in consultative processes.
</p>
<p>With this objective we are providing an outline of the Draft Vision Document of e-Courts Project Phase III. This 86 page document, drafted by a sub-committee of the E-Committee, is going to set the template of how our judiciary moves towards digitisation over the next few years.
</p>
<h3>Wait, what happened in phases I and II?</h3>
<p>Despite being perceived as stodgy and glacial (<em>often a fair criticism!</em>), the judiciary has shown a remarkable foresight for adopting technology. <a href=""https://ecommitteesci.gov.in/about-department/introduction/"">The E-Committee of the Supreme Court</a> was established way back in 2004 and has the objective of <em>‘Information and Communication Technology (ICT) enablement of the Indian Judicial System</em>’. Since then the E-Committee has introduced <a href=""https://doj.gov.in/sites/default/files/Brief-on-eCourts-Project-(Phase-I-%26-Phase-II)-30.09.2015.pdf"">Phases I and II</a> of e-Courts Project with an overall budget of approximately 2400 crores.
</p>
<p>Phase I focused on the nuts and bolts of digitisation - setting up hardware, ensuring internet connectivity, digitising case records and operationalising the e-Courts platform. Phase II provided systems which operated independent of each other and catered to the needs of the litigant, such as <a href=""https://njdg.ecourts.gov.in/njdgnew/"">National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG)</a> which permits citizens to check pendency of cases across the country, virtual courts, <a href=""https://ecommitteesci.gov.in/service/e-sewa-kendra/"">E-Seva Kendras</a> and the eCourts Services App.
</p>
<p>While this process has taken years (17 years since it started), the digitisation has helped the judiciary become more efficient. But is such efficiency sufficient, or failing to utilise existing digital tools and processes? Also, does it provide solutions that may create independent problems, or fail to address existing ones?
</p>
<h3>What is Phase III of the e-Courts Project?</h3>
<p>The draft vision document suggests a plan of action for Phase III of the eCourt Project. As per the document, Phase III, as opposed to Phase II, seeks to adopt an ‘<em>ecosystem</em>’ approach where systems interact with each other. The document suggests several ambitious developments such as a digital case registry, a repository of case law, intelligent scheduling, digital case management system, an interoperable criminal justice system, E-Filing and open digital hearings. All of these developments will be based on ‘<em>an intelligent system that enables data-based decision making for judges and registries’ and the system ‘combines the vast body of judicial data to foster legal literacy.</em>’
</p>
<p>While these developments are welcome, they will be brought in without any independent evaluation of Phase I and II of the project, as much as, without data protection legislation. Now let us, draw some broad strokes on how we are initially looking at the draft vision document. We request the IFF community to post on the <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/digitization-of-indian-judiciary-phase-iii/forum.internetfreedom.in"">Internet Freedom Forum</a> and help steer us on whether we are omitting anything or if there are any critical areas that we have failed to notice!
</p>
<h3>The good</h3>
<img src=""https://internetfreedom.in/content/images/2021/04/Twitter_-Vision-Document.png"" width=""1200"" height=""900"" style=""width:480px;height:270px;"" alt=""Twitter_-Vision-Document.png"" /><ol><li><strong>Database of legal precedents: </strong>As the vision document rightly points out, a ‘<em>database of all legal precedents must form the backbone to a judicial system based on common law’</em>. As of now, lawyers have to use websites such as Manupatra, SCCOnline and Indian Kanoon which do not provide case law from district courts. Moreover, Manupatra and SCCOnline are expensive and only further the digital divide. Lawyers also use websites of the High Courts and eCourts platform, however these only provide case law from particular courts. A freely available repository developed by the judiciary will enable lawyers from all backgrounds to undertake high quality legal research and foster legal literacy by permitting citizens to read judgments.
</li><li><strong>Data Protection: </strong>The document undertakes to develop phase III with the principle of capturing minimum personal identifiable data, keeping the transient data in memory only and storing data in anonymised ways. However, this in no way is a substitute for data protection legislation and there are problems with processing data at such a scale without a legislation. Nevertheless, the undertaking from the sub-committee that data of individuals will be protected, is encouraging.
</li><li><strong>Standardisation: </strong>Currently different lower courts use different methods to classify a case. The usage of different vocabulary makes research difficult and does not permit interoperability of data across courts. Standardisation will enable interaction of data between different services. We have faced difficulties because of the lack of standardisation. After Section 66A was struck down by the Supreme Court in <em>Shreya Singhal vs Union of India, </em>IFF collaborated with Civic Data Labs to develop <a href=""https://zombietracker.in/"">Zombie Tracker</a>, a website which tracks cases where individuals were being charged under Section 66A despite its unconstitutional status. As we have highlighted <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/update-on-zombie-tracker/"">here</a>, collecting such data was difficult because Section 66A was classified in different ways on the eCourts platform.
</li><li><strong>Research-friendly Approach:</strong> The draft vision document’s approach also involves development of infrastructural capabilities which will permit researchers, academics and private actors to undertake research and develop solutions. This is encouraging. Till now, all ‘e-services’ have been provided by the judiciary and other stakeholders have not been able to develop their own solutions which interact with the tools developed by the judiciary.
</li><li><strong>Provide templates to judges: </strong>The document proposes the creation of templates for judgments which can be used by judges. The template will be based on analysis of certain inputs by judges, other data from the case and data from similar cases that have been disposed. These templates will only be suggestions, however, and are not intended to replace the decision making process of the judge. This will help save a lot of precious judicial time, and can be a major factor in decreasing case pendency. However, we need a lot more clarity on the systems which will be used to develop such templates and deployed (think about our district courts). Here, we need clear checks to avoid it from becoming a mechanical method in which the application of mind is jettisoned in favour of operational efficiency. We are of the initial view that we should be mindful of automating justice that may also creep in risks of lack of accountability. Hence, this specific proposal should be put to rigorous scrutiny and annual reviews without any institutional bias for proceeding with it due to investment of resources.
</li></ol><h3>Some initial concerns emerge</h3>
<ol><li><strong>The distance between <em>bharat</em> and <em>digital india</em><strong><strong>: </strong></strong></strong>As we have pointed out <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/on-chronic-inequalities-in-internet-access/"">previously</a>, whether or not one has access to the internet is dependent on the demographic they belong to. While access has certainly been increasing, <a href=""https://sprf.in/digital-literacy-in-india-structural-constraints-and-the-nep-2020/"">digital literacy continues to remain low</a> and is likely to remain an issue for decades. Further, technology systems if deployed compulsorily may exclude litigants from access to court services. Hence, backward compatibility will be essential and budget outlays for physical filing and registry functions will need to be maintained for a long period of time. The document does contemplate training judges, court staff and lawyers in ‘<em>specifics of technology’. </em>The large scale digitisation does not account for how it will impact litigants on the other side of the digital divide.
</li><li><strong>Centralisation: </strong>As per Articles 227 and 235 of the Constitution, the High Courts are responsible for administration of lower judiciary. The Supreme Court can overrule the High Court on the judicial side but cannot control its administration. Admittedly, this has led to lack of standardisation which makes sharing of information across state lines difficult. Nevertheless, since the power is vested in High Courts, the E-Committee or the proposed National Judicial Technology Council ought to provide adequate measure of discretion to high courts. It may be noted that the document does say that the ‘<em>High Courts have the strategic autonomy for digitisation and configuration of digital services for their state judiciary’.</em> Moreover, the sub-committee has consulted with High Courts while preparing this document but concerns on centralisation do remain.
</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Robo Lawyer</strong></strong>s<strong><strong>: </strong></strong></strong>Another ambitious suggestion from the sub-committee is creation of a portal which will use appropriate data from eCourts database to provide a citizen information on justiciability of their case, the court with jurisdiction over their case and applicable legislations. The portal will then proceed to give information to the citizen on ‘<em>outcomes of filing a suit’ </em>or alternative dispute resolution (ADR) options. Such advice and nudges for ADR options, may if not correctly designed lead to what are termed as dark patterns that reduce individual autonomy and result in behavioural changes. We note that such proposals, while seemingly beneficial will be applied to complex questions of law and fact on which even lawyers may have different opinions. An automated portal cannot be trusted to give an authoritative answer on these questions. If such a step is undertaken, there must be grievance redressal mechanism against advice from the portal which is patently incorrect.
</li></ol><h3>Major concerns</h3>
<img src=""https://internetfreedom.in/content/images/2021/04/3.png"" width=""1200"" height=""900"" style=""width:480px;height:270px;"" alt=""3.png"" /><ol><li><strong><strong>Surveillance</strong>: </strong>The document discusses an ‘Interoperable Criminal Justice System (ICJS)’ which makes data interoperability between different institutions such as police, prisons and courts. This was implemented in part during the earlier phases but data was not entirely interoperable. In this phase, the Committee seeks to ensure ‘<em>seamless exchange of live data between arms of the criminal justice system’ </em>which will allow for ‘<em>seamless tracking and prioritising of processes’. </em>Researchers such as Srinivas Kodali have <a href=""https://twitter.com/digitaldutta/status/1380455029165879301"">pointed out</a> that since ICJS is housed within the Ministry of Home Affairs, the large scale collections of data will permit investigative agencies to undertake surveillance. This is of particular concern, since the draft vision document does not make clear how it intends to limit the purposes for which the collected data will be used and there is no data protection law and neither is there any meaningful surveillance reforms.
</li><li><strong>Delegation of judicial duties to ‘transformative technologies’: </strong>Most of the developments proposed in the document seek to computerise administrative processes. However, the document also seeks to computerise judicial duties. The document states that transformative technologies can be used to resolve cases under Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 and Employee Compensation Act, 1923 <em>‘that do need application of judicial mind’. </em>This is a radical proposal. In this regard we have the following concerns:
</li></ol><ul><li>This proposal requires an amendment to these legislations. Parliament in its wisdom has empowered judges to resolve these disputes. Such a power cannot be delegated.
</li><li>There is no clarity on what these ‘transformative technologies’ are and how they operate. If the Committee intends to empower a code to impose civil liabilities (hopefully this does not extend to criminal liabilities) on litigants, it ought to have provided more information regarding the code from the outset.
</li><li>This proposal is also seemingly contrary to the comments of the Chief Justice of India at the launch of SUPACE that artificial intelligence will not do decision making.
</li><li>Most importantly, there are serious constitutional concerns over whether a code can perform a judicial function.
</li></ul><h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>Please note that our analysis of the draft vision document are only presumptive to invite a critical lens and are open to correction. These concerns are based on an initial reading of the document and we are continuously studying it. Again, we want to hear from you and hope to encourage a broader conversation! The sub-committee has invited suggestions to the draft vision document. We are in the process of drafting these suggestions and we shall update the IFF community once we submit those suggestions. In the meantime, we encourage you to also review the document and submit their suggestions at ecommittee@aij.gov.in by <a href=""https://www.mygov.in/group-issue/inviting-suggestions-draft-vision-document-phase-iii-ecourts-project/"">April 23, 2021</a> which is the last date. You can also submit your suggestions on the <a href=""https://www.civis.vote/consultations/183/read?utm_source=Agami&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=e_courts"">CIVIS platform</a>.

<p><a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/startfromscratch-the-data-bill-series-part-1/"">Part 1</a> of our series dealt with the need for a data protection bill, and illustrated emerging threats that threaten our modern digital life. We also provided some historical context for the Bill, and gave some updates on what the future lies with respect to the report of the joint Parliamentary Committee on the Bill.
</p>
<p>Then came <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/startfromscratch-an-explainer-on-the-personal-data-protection-bill-2019/"">Part 2</a>, in which we dug into the nitty gritties and explained the various provisions of the Bill. We began with an explanation of all the definitions and jargon, and then showed how the Bill:
</p>
<ul><li>provides users with certain Rights;
</li><li>lads down a consent mechanism for the processing of personal data;
</li><li>imposes on obligations on data collectors and processors
</li><li>lays down transparency and accountability measures to be followed
</li><li>provides the government with certain exemptions
</li></ul><p>We also provided an update on the Bill: the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Personal Data Protection Bill will now be <a href=""http://loksabhaph.nic.in/Business/UserBulletin1.aspx"">releasing its report in the first week of the monsoon session</a>. As we said, this gives us time to ensure that we, the citizens of India, understand and analyse the Bill so that India can implement a robust data protection framework that protects the rights of users.
</p>
<p>In this post, we want to highlight the key issues with the Bill that we feel require the most scrutiny. Our analysis here draws heavily from our earlier work under the <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/blog"">SaveOurPrivacy</a> campaign, through which have been writing about privacy regulations vociferously over the last 2-3 years. However, while we do go into some detail in this post, our aim is to provide a sampler of issues for the reader to engage with. A more detailed and in-depth dive into these very concerns shall be forthcoming.
</p>
<h3>Dilution of user’s rights</h3>
<p>Whilst the Personal Data Protection Bill does grant individuals certain rights and protections, it also makes the exercise of these rights difficult. For example, data principals can withdraw their consent for the processing of personal data; however, it is not as easy to exercise this right as it sounds. The Bill states that if the withdrawal of consent is without any ‘valid reason’, the data subject will have to bear the legal consequences of such withdrawal. Here, the burden to prove that the reason for withdrawal was valid <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf"">is on the data principal</a>. This is against the principle of consent under the Bill which requires that consent should be as easy to give as it is easy to withdraw. Further, it is not clear what constitutes 'valid reason' and what the nature and extent of the legal consequences contemplated under the section are. The threat of legal consequences would deter the data subjects from exercising their right to withdraw consent to data processing, questioning the freeness of consent.
</p>
<p>The Bill creates a further impediment to the exercise of the rights of data principals by allowing data fiduciaries to charge a fee from the data principals for processing their requests. Such a provision does not take into account prevailing socio-economic conditions in India, and the fact that in India technology is used by the rich and the poor alike. Hence creating a fee requirement would create a gap in the exercise of the rights under the Bill, where certain rights under the <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf"">Bill would become the prerogative of the rich</a>.
</p>
<h3>Processing of data without consent</h3>
<p>Chapter III of the Bill provides for certain grounds for the processing of data without the consent of the data principals. While some of the non-consensual grounds for processing data seem to be standard clauses, there are certain provisions that raise concerns. One such provision is that personal data can be<a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf""> processed by the State without consent for delivering services or benefits</a> and for the issuance of any certification, license or permit to the data principal. This is very broad and it needs to be balanced by giving some limited rights to the data principals.
</p>
<p>The most worrisome clause under the non-consensual grounds for processing data is the exemption given to<a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/blog/workplace-surveillance-your-employer-could-be-watching-you""> employers</a>. Employers can process the data of employees without their consent for the recruitment or termination of employees, for delivering services to employees, for verifying the attendance of employees, or for the assessment of the performance of the employees. These purposes are very broad and do not respect the privacy of the employees. The blanket exemption given to the employers from the consent requirement would allow them to engage in various monitoring activities under the guise of assessment of the performance of the employees. Indeed, such practices are already taking place: for instance, the PSU Broadcasts Engineering Consultants India Limited (BECIL) had put out a tender last year <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/legal-notice-to-becil-for-its-tender-to-procure-employee-tracking-smartwatches-and-a-mass-surveillance-system/"">to procure employee tracking smartwatches</a>.
</p>
<h3>Reasonable purposes</h3>
<p>The<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/essential-features-of-a-rights-respecting-data-protection-law/""> reasonable purposes</a> clause is another exemption that allows data fiduciaries to process data without the consent of the principals. The Bill also enumerates some grounds which count as reasonable purposes. One such ground is the processing of publicly available personal data. This exemption is untenable as it undermines the fact that informational privacy does not make a distinction of publicly available personal data. This is a very dangerous exemption as it allows both the State and private actors to process publicly available data of individuals for various purposes such as discriminating against individuals based on their political and religious views, political advertisements, profiling, etc.
</p>
<h3>Social media intermediaries</h3>
<p>The <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/essential-features-of-a-rights-respecting-data-protection-law/"">voluntary verification</a> of users of social media intermediaries raises concerns of violation of privacy and profiling of users. The Bill classifies certain significant data fiduciaries as social media intermediaries and requires them to provide mechanisms to enable its users to voluntarily verify their accounts. Such verified users are given visible marks of verification. User verification and visible marks impede online anonymity, which is an important feature of the internet. Anonymity is very important in online space as it creates a safe space for the users to express their views without any fear. And it goes without saying that an attack on anonymity is an attack on privacy. Moreover, it is not proven that anonymity fuels fake news, hate speech and the online abuse on social media.
</p>
<p>Another danger inherent in the voluntary verification of users is that the social media entities get <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/here-comes-the-bill-all-dressed-in-nil/"">access to official identifiers</a> of the individuals such as ID card, Aadhar etc. Identification documents are sensitive personal data and hence the sharing of these documents requires utmost caution and care. These measures give social media entities easy access to sensitive data which can be used for creating user profiles and engage in more advanced targeting.
</p>
<h3>Surveillance</h3>
<p>The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 gives the government unabated access to personal data without <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/watch-the-watchmen-series-part-5-the-personal-data-protection-bill-2019/"">adequate checks and balances against surveillance</a>. The various provisions under the Bill are in fact enablers of State surveillance. The exemptions granted to the State under the Bill empower the Central government to exempt ‘any agency’ of the government from the provisions of the Bill, and to prescribe the procedure, safeguards and oversight mechanism to be followed by such agencies. This is quite alarming as it enables the intelligence and law enforcement agencies to process the data of the individuals without being subject to the provisions of the Bill and engage in mass surveillance. With the government having the powers to lay down the boundaries within which the surveillance has to take place the Bill makes the government the arbiter of its own actions. The broad exemptions granted to the State can render the rights and protections granted to individuals under the data protection Bill meaningless.
</p>
<h3>Independence of Data Protection Authority</h3>
<p>An <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/essential-features-of-a-rights-respecting-data-protection-law/"">independent Data Protection Authority</a> (DPA) is one of the core principles of data protection laws. The DPA has a significant role in determining the rights of the individuals under the Bill and hence, for the effective protection of the rights of individuals it is pertinent that the DPA is an independent authority. However, the independence of the DPA has been called into question by the various sections under the Bill. Firstly, the Bill does not mandate the requirement of a judicial member in the composition of the DPA. This would lead to executive dominance of the DPA impairing the independence and accountability of the DPA. Secondly, the DPA is bound by the directions of the Central Government, which only adds to concerns about the DPA essentially becoming beholden to the Centre.
</p>
<h3>Government access to non-personal data</h3>
<p>The data protection Bill is a special legislation dealing with the protection of personal data of natural persons and the application part of the Bill makes it clear that it does not apply to anonymised data under section 91 as an exception. Section 91 empowers the Central Government to <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/essential-features-of-a-rights-respecting-data-protection-law/"">access non-personal personal data</a> with any data fiduciary or data processors for framing policies for the digital economy. This section seems to be a misfit in the Bill as the objectives behind the section are not in consonance with the objectives sought to be achieved by a personal data protection regime. Moreover, the extant literature doubts the existence of anonymised personal data as anonymisation can be reversed. We have voiced similar concerns about the draft framework for the governance of non-personal data, which is <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/unconstitutional-draft-report-on-non-personal-data-ignores-concerns-about-privacy-and-data-monopolies/"">thoroughly unconstitutional and ignores concerns about privacy and data monopolies</a>.

<p>It’s here! As promised, part 2 of our series on the data bill will explain the basics of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. In it, we provide an introduction to the main definitions, explain what the Data Processing Authority is, detail what rights users will have and how these rights will be ensured in practice, and lastly, explain the exemptions provided to the government.
</p>
<h3>A Recap and an update</h3>
<p>Last time, we <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/startfromscratch-the-data-bill-series-part-1/"">discussed the need for a data protection bill</a> and indicated new threats such as <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/security-incidents-and-the-personal-data-protection-bill/"">data breaches</a>, <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/nso-pegasus-hack-one-year-anniversary/"">malicious hacks</a>, and<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/workplace-surveillance-your-employer-could-be-watching-you/""> governmental and corporate surveillance</a> that have emerged as our world becomes more and more digital. We also provided some historical context to the <a href=""https://prsindia.org/files/bills_acts/bills_parliament/Personal%20Data%20Protection%20Bill,%202019.pdf"">Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019</a> and hinted at some of the concerns that have been raised about the Bill.
</p>
<p>Regarding the report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Bill, we have an update that <a href=""https://www.medianama.com/2021/03/223-jpc-data-protection-extension-parliament/"">reports</a> had emerged that the Committee would postpone the submission of the report. Indeed, this came true, as on the 25th of March <a href=""http://loksabhaph.nic.in/Business/ListofBusiness.aspx"">a motion was moved</a> to extend the time for the presentation of the report and <a href=""http://loksabhaph.nic.in/Business/UserBulletin1.aspx"">was adopted the very same day</a>. Thus, as it stands, the report of the Committee shall be presented in the first week of the Monsoon Session of 2021.
</p>
<p>We have time. So this means that it is even more important for the public to engage with the bill, understand what it proposes, and critique its weaker aspects so that public pressure can be applied and India implements a stronger data protection bill.
</p>
<h3>A Glossary</h3>
<p>The most important definitions vis-à-vis the data bill are:
</p>
<ol><li><strong>Data principal</strong> i.e. you, the user. A data principal is essentially the person to whom the data ‘belongs’
</li><li><strong>Data fiduciary</strong> i.e. the entity that controls the storage of the data and defines the permitted ways it can be processed
</li><li><strong>Data processor</strong> i.e. the entity that processes that data collected by a data fiduciary
</li></ol><p>Suppose you use a certain social medium (eg. Facebook or Twitter). In this case, you are the data principal, the social medium is the data fiduciary (since it collects data about you and your activity on its medium), and the entity that processes your data for, say, advertising purposes is the data processor (this may be an authorised third party entity or even the social medium itself).
</p>
<p>Next, we need understand the categories of data:
</p>
<ol><li><strong>Personal Data: </strong>This refers to data that may contain information about any characteristics or traits of a person and can be used to identify said person.
</li><li><strong>Sensitive Personal Data:</strong> This refers to certain categories of data such as: financial data, health data, official identifiers; data on sexual orientation and activity, biometric data, genetic data, transgender status, intersex status, caste or tribe status, and religious or political belief or affiliation.
</li><li><strong>Critical Personal Data:</strong> Any data notified by the Central Government to be critical data. The important thing here is that critical data can only be processed within the country.
</li></ol><h3>But who will enforce the law? A Data Protection Authority</h3>
<p>The Bill (Chapter IX) proposes the creation of a Data Protection Authority (DPA). Essentially, the DPA will be the main regulator with respect to the processing of data. The Bill’s Statement of Objects and Reasons states that role of the DPA would be to:
</p>
<blockquote>“protect the interests of data principals, prevent any misuse of personal data, ensure compliance with the provisions of the proposed legislation and promote awareness about the data protection”</blockquote>
<p>The Authority shall consist of one Chairperson and a maximum of 6 other full-time members, of which at least one shall have experience in law. The chairperson shall be appointed by the Central government and shall be responsible for directing the workings of the DPA.
</p>
<p>Now, given the central role of the Authority, several important functions have been delegated to it, including:
</p>
<ul><li>Monitoring and enforcing application of the provisions of this Act
</li><li>Taking prompt and appropriate action in response to personal data breach in accordance with the provisions of this Act
</li><li>Examination of any data audit reports and taking any action pursuant thereto
</li><li>Specifying codes of practice to promote good practices of data protection and facilitate compliance
</li><li>Promoting awareness and understanding of the risks, rules, safeguards and rights in respect of protection of personal data amongst data fiduciaries and data principals
</li><li>Promoting measures and undertaking research for innovation in the field of protection of personal data
</li><li>Advising Central Government, State Government and any other authority on measures required to be taken to promote protection of personal data and ensuring consistency of application and enforcement of this Act
</li></ul><p>Apart from these, the Authority also has the power to:
</p>
<ul><li>Issue directions to any data fiduciary or data processor (who are bound to comply with the orders)
</li><li>Ask data fiduciaries or data processors to provide any relevant information
</li><li>Conduct an enquiry about any data fiduciary or data processor if it believes that it has conducted its activities in a manner that infringes upon the digital rights of users or if it believes the entity has contravened any of the provisions of the Act
</li></ul><p>Thus, as one can see, the Data Protection Authority will play a vital role. But what will be the regulatory environment that DPA will protect and regulate? Read on.
</p>
<h3>Digital Rights and Consent</h3>
<p>User consent is recognised as a key component of data protection frameworks, and this is recognised in clause 11 of the Bill, which lays down that personal data cannot be processed without obtaining the consent of the user. Furthermore, such consent is valid only if it is: a) freely given, b) on the basis of an informed decision, c) specific in nature, d) clearly expressed, and e) capable of being withdrawn. Users must also be informed about any harms that might result as a consequence of providing consent, while the provision of services cannot be made contingent upon the provision of services or the fulfillment of a contract.
</p>
<p>There are, of course, certain exemptions. For example, if the processing of certain personal data is without consent may be allowed for the prevention and detection of any unlawful activity including fraud, whistle blowing, network and information security, and the operation of search engines. Additionally, there are certain exemptions that are provided to governmental agencies. More on this below.
</p>
<p>Along with a consent framework, the Bill, in Chapter V, lays down certain rights that each data principal has:
</p>
<ol><li><strong>Right to confirmation and access:</strong> Users have the right to obtain their personal data as well as a summary of activities performed upon their data in a clear and concise manner.
</li><li><strong>Right to correction and erasure:</strong> Users have the right to correct, complete, and update their personal data. Users also have the right to erase their personal data after it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was processed
</li><li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> Users have the right to receive and have transferred to any other fiduciary their personal data as well as any data generated during the provision of services.
</li><li><strong>Right to be Forgotten:</strong> Users have the right to restrict or prevent the disclosure of their personal data if it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected or if they withdraw their consent.
</li></ol><p>Here too however, these rights are not absolute, in the sense that certain limits, technical and otherwise, are imposed upon them. For example, in the case of the right to correction and erasure, a data fiduciary may, after providing the user with an explanation, choose to reject their application, though the user can make the fiduciary tage the data as disputed. Alternatively, in the case of the right to be forgotten, all requests need to go through an Adjudicating Officer appointed by the Data Protection Authority, who will judge whether any such request is valid.
</p>
<h3>Interregnum - What about non-personal data?</h3>
<p>You may have noticed that most of these provisions seem to deal with personal data, and so you may ask: what about non-personal data? Well, clause 2 of the Bill says that the provisions of the Bill shall not apply to anonymised data, while clause 91 empowers the Central government to: a) ask data fiduciaries and data processors to provide anonymised personal data or non-personal data to improve service delivery and b) frame policies with respect to non-personal data (as an aside, we will mention here that government released the second version of the draft non-personal data governance framework on 16th December last year, which we have written about <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/unconstitutional-draft-report-on-non-personal-data-ignores-concerns-about-privacy-and-data-monopolies/"">here</a>).
</p>
<h3>Obligations &amp; Transparency Measures</h3>
<p>Another important part of a robust data protection framework is the regulation of the data collection and processing. For this purpose, chapter II of the Bill lays down certain obligations on data fiduciaries. Firstly, personal data shall only be processed for clear and lawful purposes that a user has consented to, and the privacy of the user shall be ensured while processing. Data can be processed only to the extent that is necessary for the intended purpose, and a notice containing all the relevant information must be sent to the user before collecting their data. The fiduciary must also take the necessary steps to ensure that the personal data processed is complete, accurate, and up to date. Additionally, data fiduciaries must respect the digital rights of users and retain their personal data beyond the time necessary for fulfilling the original purpose of processing, after which such data must be deleted.
</p>
<p>To complement these obligations, the Bill (Chapter VI) mandates certain procedural measures that data fiduciaries must implement. Each data fiduciary must implement a comprehensive privacy-by-design policy that explains how the privacy of users and the security of their data is going to be ensured throughout processing, they can get to be certified by the Data Protection Authority if it is found to be sufficiently robust. Fiduciaries must also certain information available in a transparent manner, such as:
</p>
<ul><li>the categories of personal data generally collected and the manner of such collection
</li><li>the purposes for which personal data is generally processed
</li><li>any categories of personal data processed in exceptional situations or any exceptional purposes of processing that create a risk of significant harm
</li><li>the existence of and the procedure for exercise of rights of data principal under Chapter V and any related contact details for the same
</li></ul><p>Some data fiduciaries will also end up being classified as significant data fiduciaries based on factors such as the volume of data processed and the turnover of the fiduciary. Such classification will bring with it additional obligations, such as the need to conduct data protection audits and impact assessments as well as the need to have a designated data protection officer.
</p>
<p>Both data fiduciaries and processors shall implement necessary security safeguards, such as:
</p>
<ul><li>The use of methods such as de-identification and encryption
</li><li>Take steps necessary to protect the integrity of personal data
</li><li>Take steps necessary to prevent misuse, unauthorised access to, modification, disclosure or destruction of personal data
</li><li>Undertake periodic reviews of their security safeguards
</li></ul><p>They must also have in place an effective grievance redressal mechanism, in which complaints must be disposed of within 30 days of their receipt.
</p>
<p>The data protection Bill also specifies behaviour in case a breach occurs: data fiduciaries must inform the DPA about any breaches of personal data, detailing the type and nature of the data involved and the number of persons affected. The DPA shall then decide whether the breach should be reported to the users. The DPA may also direct the fiduciary in question to take certain actions.
</p>
<h3>Exemptions, governmental and otherwise</h3>
<p>The Bill provides for a variety of exemptions and these are some of its most criticised sections. For example, chapter III of the Bill states that personal data may be processed without consent in certain situations, including:
</p>
<ol><li>The performance of any State function, such as the provision of a service or statutory benefit
</li><li>In compliance with any order or judgement of a Court or a Tribunal
</li><li>In case of a medical emergency for the data principal
</li><li>For the provision of public health services to combat a pandemic or any other threat to the public health
</li><li>By an employer with respect to a data principal who is an employee
</li></ol><p>Chapter VII of the Bill provides even broader exemptions to the government: the Central Government can, in the interest of national security and the prevention of incitement to any cognizable offence, <strong>exempt any government agency</strong> from any of the provisions of the Bill. The Centre can also exempt data processors that process the data of users outside India from the provisions of the Bill.

<p>On March 25, 2021, one of IFF's second appeals in the Central Information Commission (CIC) was up for hearing for the disclosure of comments on a public consultation on the Personal Data Protection Bill. The CIC accepted our submissions and directed the Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) to re-visit the RTI application and provide us with a revised reply and the comments, if no valid exemptions could be claimed.
</p>
<h3>Background and sequence of events</h3>
<p>The drafting, vendor selection and choices made by the, ""expert"" committee have been the subject of a long standing controversy in which<a href=""https://www.epw.in/engage/article/politics-indias-data-protection-ecosystem""> civil society has criticised it for lacking diversity and expertise</a>. This can only be overcome with transparency. To further this we filed RTI's seeking greater information not only on it's working but the comments which were sent in response to a public consultation. This disclosure has been strangely resisted by MeitY leading us to take this case to take this case to the CIC.

The submissions alluded to, will later translate into input that goes into the draft bill, that has to be approved by the Cabinet before it is introduced in parliament.”</blockquote>
<p>While the RTI Act provides the right to the public to seek information from the government to its activities, it also offers the government various exemptions from providing such information in cases such as state secrets, cabinet papers, danger to life or physical safety of an individual etc. However, to ensure procedural fairness, the government must clearly state which exemption it is invoking, when refusing to provide information. In this case, the CPIO did not cite any provision of the Right to Information Act, 2005 to support their rejection of the our request, and as such, their refusal to provide us with information was without basis, arbitrary, illegal, and in violation of a plethora judgments of Courts such as the judgment of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in <em><a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nuO4TJ-RHxvfrADCJbNBy5QaoT3zFGjt/view?usp=sharing"">Sh. Rakesh Kumar Gupta v CIC</a></em>, WP (C) No. 900/2021, dated January 22, 2021, which stated that the CPIO cannot withhold information without reasonable cause.
</p>
<h3>We file a first appeal</h3>
<p>Accordingly, on December 4, 2018, we filed an appeal before the First Appellate Authority (‘FAA’) against this reply of the CPIO. However, on December 18, 2018, the FAA disposed off the first appeal by stating that, “Under section 8.1(i) of RTI Act 2005, the information cannot be shared”. Section 8(1)(i) of RTI Act, 2005 states that:
</p>
<blockquote>Section 8: Exemption from disclosure of information.<br />(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen,—<br />(i) cabinet papers including records of deliberations of the Council of Ministers, Secretaries and other officers.
<br /></blockquote>
<h3>We persist with a second appeal</h3>
<p>Not receiving a satisfactory response from the FAA, we filed a second appeal before the CIC. The second appeal was taken up for hearing before the CIC on March 25, 2021, where IFF's Of Counsel Advocate <a href=""https://twitter.com/VrindaBhandari"">Vrinda Bhandari</a> was accompanied by CCG Litigation Fellow who is hosted at IFF, <a href=""https://twitter.com/krishnesh78"">Krishnesh Bapat</a>.
</p>
<p>We raised the following (among other) grounds at the hearing and in our <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v4ByKL45IYUXaDMRAFkXjowBeS7SzL1O/view?usp=sharing"">written submissions</a>:
</p>
<ol><li>The exemption under Section 8(1)(i) is limited to Cabinet Papers and accompanying materials submitted to the Cabinet Secretariat for deliberation. It does not apply to preparatory and other background information (such as. stakeholder consultations, file notings, etc.) which do not constitute a part of Cabinet Papers. Further, in relation to Section 8(1)(i) of the RTI Act, the Full Bench of the Hon’ble CIC in <em>Venkatesh Nayak v. Dept. of Personnel &amp; Training</em> (CIC/WB/C/2010/000120) dated August 30, 2010 had clarified that the exemption under Section 8(1)(i):
</li></ol><blockquote><em>""will apply only when a Note is submitted by the Ministry that has formulated it to the Cabinet Secretariat for placing this before the Cabinet. All concomitant information preceding that, which does not constitute a part of that Cabinet Note will then be open to disclosure u/s 4 (1)(c), but in a manner as will not violate the provisions of Sec 8(1)(i).""</em>
<br /></blockquote>
<ol><li>Section 4(1)(c) of the RTI Act, 2005 states that public authorities are mandated to disclose all relevant facts relating to important policies or decisions affecting the general public. Comments and suggestions based on which the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill was revised as well as information pertaining to the persons involved in the revision fall squarely within the ambit of this. Instead, the FAA simply rejected the our first appeal by citing an exemption under Section 8(1)(i) without providing any explanations as to the applicability of the exemption.
</li><li>The decisions of the CPIO and the FAA are contrary to the well-settled principle that denial of access to information under Section 8 of the RTI Act is an exemption that has to be construed strictly (See <em><a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/27009576/"">Supreme Court of India v. Subhash Chandra Agarwal</a></em>, (2020) 5 SCC 481, para 133) Consequently, any withholding of information under the garb of Section 8 must be accompanied by applicable reasons for doing the same.
</li></ol><p>We also submitted that Section 8(2) provides that regardless of exemptions provided under Section 8(1), a public authority may allow access to information if the public interest in disclosure outweighs the harm to the protected interests. In the present case, there is significant public interest because the inputs form the basis of the draft of a law prepared by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology prior to being placed before the Cabinet before it is introduced in the Parliament.
</p>
<p>We also received <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D6wFMHg9c8n8S-UjDptJVq8l9OHhXJbg/view?usp=sharing"">written submissions from the CPIO</a> in which they raised an additional defense on the basis of Section 8(1)(c) of the RTI Act, 2005 which states that, ""<em>information, the disclosure of which would cause a breach of privilege of Parliament or the State Legislature</em>"", is exempted from disclosure.
</p>
<h3>Persistence pays off (kinda)</h3>
<p>After hearing us, and giving a chance to the CPIO to be heard, the Information Commissioner, in her <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gw16PGzRW8UR2lrpqWMV8MO39gisSqGl/view?usp=sharing"">decision</a>, made the following observations:
</p>
<ol><li>The reply of the CPIO was grossly improper as the CPIO had failed to refer to any specific exemption clause enumerated u/s 8 of the RTI Act, 2005.
</li><li>The FAA claimed exemption u/s 8(1)(i) but again failed to justify the exemption so claimed.
</li><li>The CPIO after giving a reply stating that all documents are confidential, prior to the hearing claimed exemption u/s 8(1)(c) i.e. a new clause and again failed to justify the exemption so claimed, nor was any officer able to do so during the hearing.
</li><li>Under the provisions of Section 19 (5) of the RTI Act, 2005, in an appeal proceeding, the onus to prove that a denial of a request was justified shall be on the CPIO. The CPIO in his reply had clearly failed to justify his position as to how the disclosure of information would be in contravention of any of the provisions enshrined under Section 8 of the RTI Act, 2005 and what matter is confidential. In this context, the Commission referred to the decision of the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in the matter of <em>Dy. Commissioner of Police v. D.K. Sharma</em>, WP (C) No. 12428 of 2009 dated 15.12.2010, wherein it was held as under:
</li></ol><blockquote>""6. This Court is inclined to concur with the view expressed by the CIC that in order to deny the information under the RTI Act the authority concerned would have to show a justification with reference to one of the specific clauses under Section 8 (1) of the RTI Act. In the instant case, the Petitioner has been unable to discharge that burden.""</blockquote>
<p>Accordingly, in her decision, the Information Commissioner directed the CPIO to
</p>
<blockquote>""re-visit the RTI application and provide a revised reply to the appellant as per the provisions of the RTI Act including mentioning the correct clause of the RTI Act under which exemption is being sought for denial of information and proper justification for the same. The CPIO should note that in case she is not able to justify the exemption so claimed, then the desired information should be provided to the appellant. This direction is to be complied within a period of 15 days from the date of receipt of this order under intimation to the Commission.""</blockquote>
<p>IFF is committed and will keep persisting for greater transparency around the Data Protection Bill to ensure that it serves the rights of everyday, ordinary Indians than unaccountable powers and exemptions that act against their interests.

<p>India is witnessing one of the most significant data breaches in history. Users, security researchers and news organisations have reported that data of 10 crore Indians, including their passport details, addresses and phone numbers, is available for sale on the dark web. As per press reports, the data was in the custody of MobiKwik, which provides a mobile based payment system. While MobiKwik has denied the data breach, independent security researchers and <a href=""https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/as-data-leak-claims-resurface-mobikwik-plans-forensic-audit-7251966/"">Indian Express</a> have verified that details of MobiKwik users are available on the dark web. We have <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cXXVX2qqqCx0SRo8DuoZHa4wFM682-c8/view?usp=sharing"">written</a> to the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-IN) asking them to initiate an inquiry over the data breach in terms of Section 70B(6) of the Information Technology Act, 2000. In this post, we point out the five steps MobiKwik must take to alleviate the situation.
</p>
<h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
<p>Over the past month, several users, <a href=""https://www.deccanherald.com/business/technology/data-of-10-crore-mobikwik-users-on-sale-on-darknet-elliot-anderson-backs-researchers-claim-company-denies-breach-967962.html"">independent security researchers</a> and <a href=""https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/mobikwik-database-leaked-on-dark-web-company-denies-any-data-breach-7251448/"">news organisations</a> have reported that data - over 8.2 TB in size - of MobiKwik users has been put on sale over the dark web with an asking price of 1.5 Bitcoin which is approximately equal to INR 65 Lakhs. This data leak contains Know Your Customer (KYC) details, passport details, addresses, email ids, phone numbers and aadhar card details of around 10 Crore Indians and violates their right to privacy. The data breach follows a <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/security-incidents-and-the-personal-data-protection-bill/"">number of other data breaches</a> that have affected Indians.
</p>
<h3><strong>MobiKwik’s response</strong></h3>
<p>MobiKwik provides access to mobile based payment systems developed by the National Payments Corporation of India. The breach was <a href=""https://twitter.com/rajaharia/status/1367438237921243142"">first uncovered</a> on 4th March 2021. MobiKwik responded by denying the breach and <a href=""https://twitter.com/MobiKwik/status/1367489330902675463"">threatened</a> to take legal action against the security researcher who uncovered the breach and suggested that the researcher was ‘<em>trying to grab media attention</em>’. In the past few days, in wake of <a href=""https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/as-data-leak-claims-resurface-mobikwik-plans-forensic-audit-7251966/"">numerous reports</a> verifying the data breach, MobiKwik released a <a href=""https://blog.mobikwik.com/message-from-the-company/"">blogpost</a> where they again denied the data breach and have claimed that the breach could be because users ‘<em>have uploaded their information on multiple platforms’.</em><br /></p>
<p>MobiKwik’s denial, which shifts the blame upon users, must be taken with a pinch of salt. Independent researchers have <a href=""https://www.databreaches.net/in-threat-actor-offers-to-sell-8-tb-of-mobikwiks-personal-and-financial-data-on-almost-100m-consumers/"">indicated</a> that a data breach has occurred. <a href=""https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/as-data-leak-claims-resurface-mobikwik-plans-forensic-audit-7251966/"">Indian Express</a> has verified that details of MobiKwik users are available on the dark web. Other <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/mobikwik-investigating-data-breach-after-100m-user-records-found-online/"">reports</a> even suggest that MobiKwik has sought help from Amazon last month after they discovered that some person who did not belong to their organisation, downloaded their ‘<em>S3 data</em>’.
</p>
<h3><strong>What we expect from MobiKwik</strong></h3>
<p>We believe that MobiKwik, like many Indian technology companies, need to do better given they are today driving global innovation. It is disappointing for MobiKwik, to dismiss reports of a data breach and also issue threats against a security researcher - both steps which are against the interests of its users. We think it is necessary for MobiKwik to immediately undertake the following five steps to alleviate the situation:<br /></p>
<ol><li><strong>Inform users:</strong> MobiKwik should individually inform each affected user of the extent to which the data breach has impacted them.
</li><li><strong>Provide redressal to users: </strong>MobiKwik should devise and implement a strategy to provide adequate remedies to such users, including but not limited to compensation to the users in terms of Section 43A of the Information Technology Act, 2000.
</li><li><strong>Fix accountability: </strong>MobiKwik should provide an explanation on why such a breach took place, provide details of the breach, including the number of users affected by the breach and the date and time on which the breach took place, and issue a statement explaining the steps taken to ensure such a breach does not occur in the future.
</li><li><strong>Permit a third-party audit</strong>: The circumstances require that an independent agency conducts a forensic data security audit. We commend MobiKwik for making a public commitment to conduct it but it must be done independently through a firm of repute and its findings must be made public.
</li><li><strong>Recall threat of legal action: </strong>As mentioned above, MobiKwik has threatened to take legal steps against the cyber security researcher who uncovered the data breach. As we have pointed out <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/security-researchers-need-legislative-protection-from-vexatious-lawsuits/"">previously</a>, cyber security researchers constantly face threats of legal prosecution even when they disclose data breaches in good faith. While there <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-50583733"">remains a need</a> to provide legislative protection to such researchers, threatening researchers with legal prosecution is irresponsible. MobiKwik should immediately recall such threats especially since many users and other independent cybersecurity researchers have also claimed that a data breach has occurred.
</li></ol><h3><strong>Letter to Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-IN)</strong></h3>
<p>In view of the massive data breach, violation of the right to privacy and the lack of a response by MobiKwik, we wrote a letter to CERT-IN. Under the Information Technology Act, 2000, CERT-IN is responsible for collecting, analysing, and disseminating information on cyber incidents and undertaking measures to handle cybersecurity incidents. In the letter, we have highlighted the concerns we have raised above and requested CERT-IN to conduct an inquiry into the data breach and conduct of MobiKwik, and require executives of MobiKwik to provide detailed explanations to their office in terms of Section 70B(6) of the Information Technology Act, 2000. We are hopeful that an enquiry by CERT-IN may compel MobiKwik to act responsibly and even provide compensation to its users as per Section 43A of the Information Technology Act, 2000.
</p>
<h3><strong>Personal Data Protection Bill does not provide safeguards #SaveOurPrivacy</strong></h3>
<p>A broader policy ask also arises from this specific incident as we have highlighted it in the past with respect to data breaches by other entities, both public and private. Considering the frequency and the scale of such data breaches, Parliament must provide statutory protections to users whose rights are violated. As we have <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/security-incidents-and-the-personal-data-protection-bill/"">pointed out</a> previously, the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (PDPB) does contain several clauses relating to security and breaches. For example, Clause 25 deals with the breach of personal data. The clause states that in cases where a data breach may cause harm to the data principal, the data fiduciary must inform the proposed Data Protection Authority. However, the clause does not require the data fiduciary (in this case, MobiKwik) to inform the data principal (in this case, users whose data is now public). It is instead left to the Authority to decide: a) whether the data fiduciary must inform the data principal, b) the remedial action the data fiduciary must undertake, and c) the details of the data breach that can be made public.
</p>
<p>In contradistinction to PDPB, a private member bill <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DReq96e-FLsSoKUvK94_-VCtu2Y1PE97/view"">(the Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019)</a> introduced by MP D. Ravikumar guarantees data subjects the right to be informed about any breaches of their personal information, and also asks organisations to designate privacy officers to ensure security compliance.
</p>
<p>Currently, PDPB is being reviewed by a Joint Parliamentary Committee. A conversation around PDPB is the need of the hour and we have <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/startfromscratch-the-data-bill-series-part-1/"">started</a> a four-part series where we will talk about the need for a data law, the current bill’s provisions and loopholes, what good data bills actually look like, where accountability from authorities is needed, and what you can do to advocate for your rights.
</p>
<p>Apart from providing statutory protection to data principals, a crucial aspect of data regulation is ‘data minimization’. The principle of <a href=""https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/Data-Minimization"">data minimization</a> involves limiting data collection to only what is required to fulfill a specific purpose. Cumbersome KYC processes result in companies having access to large amounts of data without necessarily having the ability to securely store such data.

<p>Today the Delhi High Court issued notice to Public Information Officers of DeitY, MeitY, NeGD and NIC in a writ petition filed by RTI activist and independent journalist, Saurav Das. The petition challenged the Central Information Commisison’s refusal to grant Mr. Das a hearing prior to disposing of his complaint based on the government's misleading claim that the information sought by him regarding the creation of the Aarogya Setu app was already available in the public domain.
</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Since May 2020, RTI activist and independent journalist, Saurav Das has been trying to obtain information about creation of the Aarogya Setu mobile app which was launched by the Indian government as a COVID-19 surveillance measure. The app has courted controversy due to the involvement of private sector volunteers in its development and its mandatory nature. Compared to international best practices, the Aarogya Setu app adopts a centralized model and it collects a large amount of health and location data of its users. These features of Aarogya Setu have led to concerns about misuse of personal data collected by the app for commercial and law enforcement purposes.
</p>
<p>Through his RTI work, Mr. Das has managed to uncover information about the Aarogya Setu app which shows that its current functioning <a href=""https://www.thequint.com/news/india/exclusive-govt-fails-to-implement-its-own-data-protection-safeguards-under-aarogya-setu-protocol"">does not comply</a> with provisions of the Aarogya Setu Data Access and Knowledge Sharing Protocol. However, there is still a lot of information about the creation of the app which is not available to the public. For this reason, Mr. Das had filed several RTIs with the relevant government authorities and sought a copy of the entire file relating to Aarogya Setu which would contain information about the origin of the proposal, people and government departments involved, correspondence between private sector executives and government officials, file notings, minutes of meetings etc.
</p>
<p>Shockingly, after keeping Mr. Das waiting for over three months, the Public Information Officers of the National Informatics Centre (which built the App), the National e Governance Division (responsible for e-gov projects) and the Ministry of Electronics &amp; Information Technology (which owns the App) all claimed that information relating to Aarogya Setu is not held by their respective departments.
</p>
<h3>Proceedings before the CIC</h3>
<p>On 10 September 2020, Mr. Das filed a complaint before the Central Information Commission (CIC) because the relevant government authorities were claiming ignorance about Aarogya Setu. An urgent hearing was held before the CIC on 22 October 2020 because the CIC recognized that this issue could affect the privacy of millions of Indians during the COVID-19 pandemic and irreversible harm would be caused if the usual wait time of 2 years was insisted upon.
</p>
<p>During the hearing on 22 October 2020, the CIC heard Mr. Das's submissions about the conduct of government officials who were providing evasive responses about Aarogya Setu to frustrate RTI applicants. When questioned by the CIC, Public Information Officers from MeitY, NeGD and NIC could not explain which government department held all information related to creation of Aarogya Setu. In its interim order, the CIC held that denial of information by government authorities in such a manner could not be accepted and while files may move between departments,<em> ""a citizen cannot go round in circles to find out the custodian.""</em>
</p>
<p>The CIC held a show cause hearing in the matter on 24 November 2020 but Mr. Das was not granted permission to attend the hearing <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/cic-legal-notice-aarogya-setu-show-cause-hearing/"">despite multiple requests</a>. In his absence, the CIC issued a final order uncritically accepting the government's claim that the information sought by Mr. Das was already available in the public domain. Subsequent to the final order being issued, the government authorities shared certain documents with Mr. Das which were already available in the public domain but which did not answer the specific queries in his RTI application.
</p>
<h3>Writ Petition before Delhi High Court</h3>
<p>On 17 December 2020, we filed a writ petition before the Delhi High Court on behalf of Mr. Das challenging the CIC’s refusal to grant him a hearing prior to passing the final order which incorrectly disposed of his complaint and dropped the show cause proceedings against the Public Information Officers. The petition was listed today before a Single Judge Bench of Justice Pratibha Singh who issued notice to the government and sought specific details about the documents supplied to Mr. Das and whether they actually answer the queries in his RTI application.
</p>
<p>During the hearing, Advocate Vrinda Bhandari advanced oral arguments on behalf of Mr. Das and explained the timeline of the case to highlight how he had been kept waiting since May 2020 due to the evasive conduct of government officials. She also distinguished the judgements relied upon by the Respondents and clarified that the CIC should have at least heard the Petitioner to determine whether there was a default by the Public Information Officers even if he was not provided a hearing at the time of determination of quantum of penalty. She emphasized that if the Petitioner had been present during the show cause hearing, he could have rebutted the government’s claim that all information sought by him was available in the public domain and prevented the CIC from being misled.
</p>
<p>In response, the Government Counsel maintained that all relevant information was available in the public domain and it had been supplied to the Petitioner. He further justified the delay and lack of coordination among different government departments regarding Aarogya Setu by stating that the app had been developed in record time without spending a single penny amidst a war-like situation where the priority was saving lives.
</p>
<p>Recognizing that the case involves contested issues of fact, Justice Singh directed both sides to submit a chart clearly comparing the information which had been sought by Mr. Das with information supplied by the government authorities. She also observed that the main concern was the merits of the case and expeditiously deciding the matter since the Petitioner had been seeking this information since May 2020.
</p>
<p>IFF provided legal assistance to Mr. Das for this petition and he was represented in court today by Advocates Vrinda Bhandari, Sanjana Srikumar, N. Sai Vinod and Devdutta Mukhopadhyay. The matter has been listed next on 24 February 2020 and we will keep you updated about the case proceedings.

13521,"Explainer: WhatsApp Privacy Policy Changes #SaveOurPrivacy",explainer-whatsapp-privacy-policy-changes-saveourprivacy,,,admin,2021-01-11,,Yes,live,"IFF Policy Team","<h3>tl;dr</h3>
<p>Recently, WhatsApp released an in-app notification forcing users to accept its revised privacy policy by 08 February 2021 or stop using its service entirely. The new privacy policy confirms that Facebook may now have access to messages shared with businesses on WhatsApp and it provides more insight into expansive meta data collection by WhatsApp. The latest changes to WhatsApp’s privacy policy cement the problematic status quo which has existed since the privacy policy was first updated in 2016. The changes to WhatsApp’s privacy policy in 2016 are also the subject of pending litigation before the Supreme Court of India in <em>Karmanya Singh Sareen v. Union of India, </em>where IFF is an intervenor.
</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>WhatsApp is currently witnessing a mass exodus of privacy concerned users after it released an in-app notification forcing users to accept its revised privacy policy by 08 February 2021 or stop using its service entirely. However, this is not the first time WhatsApp has changed its privacy policy to facilitate sharing of data with its parent company, Facebook. To understand what is happening, we must rewind the clock and take ourselves back to February 2014 when WhatsApp was first acquired by Facebook for USD 22 billion.
</p>
<p>When Facebook was considering acquiring WhatsApp, privacy activists read the writing on the wall and warned about potential data sharing between WhatsApp and Facebook. To allay these concerns, executives from WhatsApp publicly <a href=""https://blog.whatsapp.com/setting-the-record-straight"">committed</a> to never share data with Facebook. Based on these assurances, regulators such as the European Commission and the Federal Trade Commission greenlit the acquisition of WhatsApp by Facebook.
</p>
<h3>Volte Face in 2016</h3>
<p>Fast forward to August 2016, WhatsApp announced that it would start sharing some data with Facebook including phone numbers and last seen activity. At that time, WhatsApp <a href=""https://blog.whatsapp.com/looking-ahead-for-whats-app"">stated</a> that the changes in its privacy policy would allow Facebook to offer better friend suggestions and more relevant ads to its users. Users were given 30 days to opt-out of sharing data with Facebook for ad targeting purposes but if they failed to exercise that option within 30 days, they would have no choice but to consent to data sharing. Any new users who joined after August 2016 would also not have the choice to opt out of sharing data with Facebook.
</p>
<p>The regulators who had approved Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp based on its commitments about preserving user privacy did not take to this volte face kindly. In 2017, the <a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_17_1369"">European Commission</a> fined Facebook 110 million Euros for providing misleading information during the WhatsApp acquisition about its technical inability to link the identities of users across WhatsApp and Facebook. Prior to this in 2016 itself, data protection authorities in <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/27/13071330/facebook-whatsapp-user-data-germany-privacy"">Germany</a> and the <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-whatsapp-uk-idUSKBN13227H"">United Kingdom</a> also directed Facebook to stop collecting data of WhatsApp users.
</p>
<h3>Legal Proceedings in India</h3>
<p>The changes to WhatsApp’s privacy policy in August 2016 became the subject of litigation before the Delhi High Court in <em>Karmanya Singh Sareen &amp; Anr. v. Union of India &amp; Ors. [W.P. (C) No. 7663 of 2016]</em>. In a <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/138689631/"">judgement</a> delivered on 23 September 2016, a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court declined to grant the reliefs sought by the petitioners which included a complete and meaningful opt-out option for users even beyond the initial 30 days. A Special Leave Petition was filed by the petitioners before the Supreme Court challenging the Delhi High Court’s order and IFF is also an intervenor in these proceedings.
</p>
<p>During the course of hearings before the Supreme Court in <em>Karmanya Singh Sareen &amp; Anr. v. Union of India &amp; Ors. [S.L.P. (C) No. 804 of 2017], </em>IFF has advanced arguments about the need to preserve privacy of meta data even if the actual content of messages is encrypted. Meta data means data which describes or gives information about other data, and it includes information like which users do you chat with, how frequently do you chat with a user, which groups you are a member of etc. In many cases, meta data by itself can reveal very sensitive information about a person’s life. For instance, consider conversations with sexual and reproductive health services which now provide abortion related counselling via WhatsApp.
</p>
<p>The case is still pending before the Supreme Court and it was last listed in March 2020 but it did not come up for hearing. You can read more about the history of the case <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/iff-will-represent-your-digital-rights-in-the-whatsapp-privacy-case/"">here</a>.
</p>
<h3><br />Latest Changes to the Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>The latest changes to WhatsApp’s privacy policy cement the problematic status quo which has existed since the privacy policy was first changed in 2016. As TechCrucnch <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/25/whatsapp-to-share-user-data-with-facebook-for-ad-targeting-heres-how-to-opt-out/?guccounter=1"">explained</a> back in 2016, Facebook is particularly keen to collect phone numbers of users through WhatsApp because it cannot do so through its own service. An individual can make a Facebook account by just using an email ID but providing one’s phone number is necessary to create a WhatsApp account. Therefore, phone numbers are the final piece of the puzzle in building a 360 degree profile of users, and linking identities across both platforms would certainly enhance Facebook’s ability to influence the behaviour of its users through personalized and targeted advertising. This explanation seems plausible especially in light of Facebook’s <a href=""https://privacyinternational.org/report/3025/facebook-must-explain-what-its-doing-your-phone-number-update"">unsavoury track record</a> of using phone numbers shared by individuals for security purposes like 2 factor authentication for advertising.
</p>
<p>According to a <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218989/signal-new-signups-whatsapp-facebook-privacy-controversy-elon-musk"">statement</a> by WhatsApp, the main change introduced by the new privacy policy released on 04 January 2021 is clarifying that <em>“going forward businesses can choose to receive secure hosting services from our parent company Facebook to help manage their communications with their customers on WhatsApp.” </em>This means that Facebook may now have access to messages that users share with businesses on WhatsApp. This has been <a href=""https://about.fb.com/news/2020/10/privacy-matters-whatsapp-business-conversations/"">admitted</a> by Facebook and the company claims that it <em>“will not automatically use messages to inform the ads that a user sees” </em>but <em>“businesses will be able to use chats they receive for their own marketing purposes, which may include advertising on Facebook.” </em>Considering Facebook’s past record on privacy, we will let you decide whether these assurances can be trusted.
</p>
<p>In addition to this, the new privacy policy also confirms expansive data collection by WhatsApp, which is evident from the following:
</p>
<ul><li>The new policy provides more details about the usage and log information and device and connection information collected by WhatsApp which demonstrate the highly invasive and granular nature of meta data collection by WhatsApp. For instance, the updated policy clarifies that WhatsApp is also collecting information like battery levels and signal strength.
</li><li>The new policy reveals that even if a user does not use their location-relation features, WhatsApp collects their IP addresses and other information like phone number area codes to estimate general location (city, country).
</li><li>The new policy states that for users of their payment service, WhatsApp will start processing payment account and transaction information which includes information about payment method, shipping details and transaction amount.
</li></ul><p>What's the worst part? There is no option to users, except to click on, “I Agree.” If you don't want to give in, we suggest you consider switching to a more secure platform like Signal and also join us in pushing for enactment of a strong data protection legislation in India.

<p>Following multiple reports of the use of exam proctoring technology by various universities across the country, we wrote to the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the Ministry of Education highlighting the shortcomings of this technology and asking them to issue detailed guidelines for conducting online examinations.<br /></p>
<h1>What is exam proctoring technology?</h1>
<p>Proctoring technology uses AI powered algorithms and tools to keep a check on candidates during online exams. Firstly, proctoring technology uses facial recognition to verify the student’s identity through 1:1 identification. Further, it surveils and records not only the surrounding audio of the student taking the online exam, who has to ensure that there is no noise in the background, but also monitors changes in their line of sight while capturing continuous photographs at intervals of about 15 to 20 seconds, which can amount to 200 to 240 images in an hour. In addition to this, the proctoring technology also continuously monitors all ongoing activity on the student’s screen. According to various reports, this technology is being used in various forms at <a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/upes-insisting-on-taking-exams-via-app-that-has-technical-glitches-complain-students/articleshow/79649225.cms"">University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun</a>, <a href=""https://indianexpress.com/article/education/delhi-technological-university-to-conduct-end-semester-examinations-online-dtu-ac-in-6397111/"">Delhi Technological University</a>, <a href=""https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/op-jindal-global-university-admissions-go-fully-online/1823395"">O.P. Jindal Global University, Sonipat</a>, <a href=""https://iiitdmkl.codetantra.com/#Customers"">SRM University, Chennai</a>, <a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharashtra-testing-times-for-universities-as-foolproof-proctoring-a-challenge/articleshow/79790886.cms"">Mumbai University and IIT-Bombay</a> to name a few.
</p>
<h1>Why are we concerned?</h1>
<h2>A. It is a highly invasive technology.</h2>
<p>In addition to being highly invasive as can be seen above, use of this highly invasive technology has led to higher levels of stress and anxiety in students who have already been one of the worst affected groups in the pandemic. The constant threat of being flagged by the technology for a perceived wrongful action in addition to the stress of the exam being given leads to a <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21232777/examity-remote-test-proctoring-online-class-education"">student having heightened anxiety levels</a>. Here, it is worth mentioning that even while being highly invasive this technology is not fool-proof with multiple viral videos online on how to cheat such proctoring technology. <br /></p>
<h2>B. Multiple privacy concerns arise.</h2>
<p>Proctoring technology gathers and retains invasive biometric data as well as personally identifiable information (PII) to determine the student’s identity and whether the student is cheating. It collects data such as full name, date of birth, address, phone number, scans of government-issued identity documents, educational institution affiliation, and student ID numbers. Additionally, they also gather information on the devices being used by the student such as <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/08/proctoring-apps-subject-students-unnecessary-surveillance"">records of operating systems, make and model of the device, as well as device identification numbers, IP addresses, browser type and language settings, software on the device and their versions, ISP, records of URLs visited, and how long students remain on a particular site or webpage.</a><br /></p>
<p>In addition to this data which they gather, they also generate additional data which includes records of gaze or line of sight tracking, records of surrounding audio and records of the continuous video surveillance of the student including almost 200 to 240 photographs which the technology takes at regular intervals throughout the exam. While such gathering and retaining of data is <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/08/proctoring-apps-subject-students-unnecessary-surveillance"">objectively harmful</a>, the harms are increased in India where we do not currently have a data protection law in place to ensure the data privacy of students. Here, it is also worth mentioning that minors are given a higher standard of protection in most data protection regimes across the world. <br /></p>
<p>As per the Hon’ble Supreme Court's decision in <em>Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India</em> (2017 10 SCC 1) any justifiable intrusion by the State into people’s right to privacy protected under Article 21 of the Constitution must conform to certain thresholds. These thresholds are legality, necessity, proportionality and procedural safeguards which the universities have failed to meet.<br /></p>
<h2>C. Other technical issues may affect candidature or outcome of exam.</h2>
<p><a href=""https://thewire.in/education/jamia-milla-islamia-online-exams-discrimination"">Circumstances which are out of the control</a> of the student may end up having an adverse effect on their candidature under the watchful eyes of the proctoring technology. No person can ensure complete silence in his/her surroundings while taking an exam in a residential setting. Additionally, technological issues in the devices being used can arise unexpectedly which cannot be controlled by the student taking the exam. Lastly, technical glitches may be present in the proctoring technology itself, as has been reported by students of various universities which are deploying proctoring technology obtained from an EdTech Startup called <a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/upes-insisting-on-taking-exams-via-app-that-has-technical-glitches-complain-students/articleshow/79649225.cms"">CodeTantra</a>.<br /></p>
<p>Internet connectivity which is fast, reliable and affordable is one of the main requirements of proctoring technology however it is still a sensitive issue in India with many remote areas still not having access to the internet as well as the ongoing internet shutdown in Jammu &amp; Kashmir which limits access to only 2G internet.<br /></p>
<h1>Our recommendations</h1>
<p>In light of the above concerns, we wrote to the UGC and to the Ministry of Education with the following recommendations:
</p>
<ol><li>Issue a directive halting the use of proctoring technology by universities to conduct online examinations.
</li><li>Issue detailed guidelines on how online examinations should be conducted while ensuring necessary privacy protections are put in place as per the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s decision in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India (Right to Privacy Judgement).<br /></li></ol><h1>Important documents</h1>

<p>Replies to Right to Information requests filed to the Committee of Experts working on the Non-Personal Data Governance framework highlight an underlying transparency problem which has been mirrored throughout 2020 by various other such data-related consultations by the Government. As we await this draft report, ""non-personal data"" remains a badly defined concept that has crept into the Data Protection Bill being deliberated by the Joint Parliamentary Committee.
</p>
<h3>RTIs responses on the Committee of Experts on NPD</h3>
<p>On August 20, 2020 we filed a <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gmNGlE4HDT1yEayNHe3ODB74_LYGUoVY/view"">Right to Information (RTI) request</a> with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology asking them to provide us with copies of documents relating to the functioning of the committee of experts, the minutes of meetings of the committee and any other document which was related to its functioning. On September 19, 2020 we received a <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gmNGlE4HDT1yEayNHe3ODB74_LYGUoVY/view"">reply</a> from them stating that the Ministry maintains no record of the internal functioning of the committee of experts.<br /></p>
<img src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/O_6HiwJdXplJiYfvLhY8MN3-fY86thNxdOnW6AsD1d_Xzs7xGi4oNuRmYCzVbYxASQkK3n_XMiX9rbrlfa3GppJlWiSPXtrCZv4qHtBB7t-OUv0Mx42QgD7CwWf44xNRTsheuaRS"" class=""kg-image"" style=""width:480px;"" alt=""O_6HiwJdXplJiYfvLhY8MN3-fY86thNxdOnW6AsD1d_Xzs7xGi4oNuRmYCzVbYxASQkK3n_XMiX9rbrlfa3GppJlWiSPXtrCZv4qHtBB7t-OUv0Mx42QgD7CwWf44xNRTsheuaRS"" /><p><br />As a next step, we filed a <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bc5A0Wd8h_SqCECeHU3r-AYOb2HRQ_Pe/view"">first appeal</a> against the reply dated October 30, 2020. In our appeal we stated that our third query pertaining to related documents does not relate to the internal working of the committee and on the contrary relates to third party correspondence, details of which can be made available easily. Additionally, submissions made to the committee can easily be provided since a record of them must exist electronically. However, in their <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bc5A0Wd8h_SqCECeHU3r-AYOb2HRQ_Pe/view"">decision</a> the First Appellate Authority (FAA) stated that there are no further inputs to our queries than what have already been provided by the CPIO in the initial reply to our RTI request.<br /></p>
<img src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-p9dMOHUFs2a4EjHYRiyeCyS7KpgJLTFLZw7QfE5HKrzFC-aeoss0-ig2rh_zhXnh7BQXBM6Pv2N3e31HSLxGR12kf70ns0ugnF848jyaKl7SLjK_1l1iJ_Q2qdF61i4sqXqLyIz"" class=""kg-image"" style=""width:480px;"" alt=""-p9dMOHUFs2a4EjHYRiyeCyS7KpgJLTFLZw7QfE5HKrzFC-aeoss0-ig2rh_zhXnh7BQXBM6Pv2N3e31HSLxGR12kf70ns0ugnF848jyaKl7SLjK_1l1iJ_Q2qdF61i4sqXqLyIz"" /><p>Both, the initial response and the decision of the FAA show a marked resistance to the goals of the RTI Act, 2005 which aims to “promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public authority”. These responses show that either the Ministry is failing to provide sufficient oversight to the committee or that there is a concerted effort to hamper transparency initiatives by civil society organizations.
</p>
<h3>Problems with the NPD framework highlighted in our submissions</h3>
<p>On September 13, 2020 we made a <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nb3UeyDbpUSvW3DmDmdra8Eh_vsMR4SM/view?usp=sharing"">submission</a> to the Ministry of Electronics and IT highlighting certain key issues with the functioning and draft report of the Committee of NPD. These issues are:
</p>
<ul><li>Ambiguity in definition and practice : The report states “non-personal data” as data which does not have personally identifiable attributes. This negative definitional framework is further divided into further classes however as noted by many commentators, this remains vague. IFF’s forum member, Tanya Varshney has written on this extensively in the context of a comparative analysis of the GDPR. She states clearly and rationally that, “The ambiguity kicks in when we are ascertaining what degree of identifiability is needed to categorize information as personal or non-personal data.”
</li><li>Ignoring the ease of re-identification : One of the central pillars of the draft report is that, “non-personal data” should not lead to re-identification. As our forum member, Shubham Jain states, “identifying what is personal data is very closely related to how difficult it is to re-identify someone from that dataset.” In the absence of a data protection law, specifically a Data Protection Authority, flirting with the idea of a non-personal data policy is laying a privacy minefield for everyday, ordinary Indians.
</li><li>Data maximisation and surveillance capitalism : The present expropriation of personal or non-personal data from silicon valley firms will not result in any clear user benefits but will lead to greater data collection and generation of sets. At a moment when India lacks a data protection law this becomes incredibly problematic for end-users. The economic assertions made within the report that non-personal data have the potential to unlock innovation and help local firms compete, is not even borne from any substantial evidence. Here, even models of competition law have been ignored. Hence, in sum, the present approach will lead to greater collection and a ratification of the problematic models of surveillance capitalism, in which even if we accept the premise of this report, data (which can easily be re-identified) will flow from foriegn entities to local ones.
</li></ul><p>Additionally, here it is also necessary to state that the currently prevailing regime on privacy in India rests largely on the Hon’ble Supreme Court's decision in <em>Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India</em> (2017 10 SCC 1). However, the draft report fails to even mention let alone follow the thresholds laid down in the decision.
</p>
<h3>""Consultation Fatigue"" ?</h3>
<p>The lack of transparency noticed in the working of the Committee of Experts on the NPD Framework can be seen to be a replication of various other consultations related to data that the government has conducted this year like the National Digital Health Mission Data Policy consultation and the Indian Artificial Intelligence Stack consultation. While we welcome and appreciate such public consultations, it is also important that these consultations drive positive changes in the policies being discussed and are not just used as a measure to fatigue civil society organisations which are already overburdened as a result of the pandemic.
</p>
<p>For instance, many of these consultations often are preceded by private meetings where the agenda and priorities are identified. This is precisely the case with the draft report on non-personal data where private meetings were conducted prior to public comment. What was discussed there? Well, we don't know yet, but will keep following through with the RTI to ensure greater transparency.

<p>Minutes of meetings of the 9th Empowered Group on Technology and Data Management provide an insider view into the creation and expansion of Aarogya Setu between 31 March 2020 to 10 August 2020. These documents were obtained by IFF through the Right to Information Act, 2005 and they contain information about several projects including the Aarogya Setu proximity exposure notification app, the ITIHAS hotspot mapping and prediction system, collection of cell tower location data by the Department of Telecom, and apps to input data regarding RT-PCR and antigen tests.
</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>In April 2020, we filed RTI applications seeking information about the Aarogya Setu app with various government authorities including the Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare (MoHFW). Since we did not receive a response to our RTI queries within the stipulated 30 day time period, we filed a first appeal with MoHFW which was transferred to the Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeitY) like the original RTI application. Finally, on 10 November 2020, DeitY shared minutes of meetings of the 9th Empowered Group Committee on Technology and Data Management held between 31 March 2020 to 10 August 2020 in response to our RTI queries.
</p>
<p>The Central Government has constituted several Empowered Groups under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 (DMA 2005) and powers have been delegated to these groups through orders which reference Sections 10(2)(h) and (i) of the Act. However, Section 10 does not permit any delegation of power and none of the provisions of DMA 2005 contain any reference to an “Empowered Group”. Therefore, the legality of this delegation of power upon Empowered Groups is questionable. The Government has constituted 11 Empowered Groups in total and the 9th Group has been specifically tasked with 'Technology and Data Management' and it is responsible for the creation and expansion of Aarogya Setu.
</p>
<p>The minutes of meetings of the 9th Empowered Group obtained through the RTI Act provide an insider view of the government's data collection projects during the COVID-19 pandemic which include the Aarogya Setu proximity exposure notification app, the ITIHAS hotspot mapping and prediction system, collection of cell tower location data by the Department of Telecom, and apps to input data regarding RT-PCR and antigen tests.
</p>
<h3>Aarogya Setu Mobile App</h3>
<p>The documents clearly state that there should be two-way sharing of data between Aarogya Setu and other databases which include the COVID India Portal (S-3) and the Ayushman Bharat System. These databases would also be connected to apps for RT-PCR and antigen tests to create a single source of truth. Here are some of the relevant portions of the minutes which descibe the relationship between different databases.
</p>
<p><strong>(i) Aarogya Setu and COVID India Portal (S-3)</strong>
</p>
<blockquote><em>""It was decided that that there should be integration of Bluetooth contact tracing data of Confirmed Positive cases from Aarogya Setu to S3 System. The contact tracing data should be visible to the district / state officers through S3 System interface enabling them to track and take necessary action for testing/ surveillance of these suspect cases. The action taken by the officers on this cases then should flow back to Aarogya setu to complete the cycle.""</em></blockquote>
<p><strong>(ii) Aarogya Setu and Ayushman Bharat</strong>
</p>
<blockquote><em>""Leads in the Aarogya Setu should be verified by Ayushman Bharat System and the filtered set of leads should be shared with states. Further feedback and action taken from field staff should flow back to Aarogya Setu.""</em><br /><br /><em>""The group was further informed that both Bluetooth and self assessment data (cleaned by Aarogya Bharat) are flowing from Aarogya Setu to S3 and vice-versa.""</em></blockquote>
<p>During the meetings, concerns were raised about sharing of health data between so many databases with Dr. Harpreet Singh, ICMR noting that <em>""lab data of Covid-19 is highly sensitive (health data) and at present there are many APIs for sharing of data with different stakeholders including NDMA, NHA &amp; others. There is need for Do’s and Don’ts with clear set of guidelines to secure the data."" </em>Government officials also seem to be aware of inaccurate reporting of a person's status by the Aarogya Setu app. For instance, during one of the meetings, Mr. RS Mani, DDG NIC highlighted <em>""the issue of false alarm (person released from hospital but status not updated)."" </em>
</p>
<p>The technical design choices of Aarogya Setu have been a subject of discussion among members of the 9th Empowered Group and officials from National Informatics Centre (NIC) were required to explain their reasons for adopting a static ID and not sharing the source code initially but these reasons are not mentioned in the minutes. NIC officials further pointed out that India could not use the Google-Apple API because it prohibited location tracking. NIC was also entrusted with the responsibility of handling the back end code of Aarogya Setu and it worked with pro bono volunteers from HP on this project.
</p>
<h3>ITIHAS Hotspot Mapping and Prediction System</h3>
<p>The minutes of meetings of the 9th Empowered Group contain several references to the ITIHAS system developed by Prof. Kamakoti, IIT Madras and NSAB for hotspot mapping and prediction. The forecasts from ITIHAS were to be integrated with the COVID India Portal (S3) and Prof. Kamakoti also made a presentation on findings from integration of ITIHAS with Aarogya Setu data. The documents also contain references to a project called 'Aarogya Rekha' being developed by Prof. Kamakoti which would be integrated with Aarogya Setu. Once this integration was done, states would then be asked to start using this tool for geographical marking of hot-spots.
</p>
<h3>Use of Cell Tower Location Data</h3>
<p>The minutes of meetings reveal that proposals to use cell tower location data to track the movement of persons was first considered in the context of the post lockdown exodus of migrants. It was decided that the Department of Telecom (DoT) would determine what kind of telecom data could be obtained about movement of migrants and this data could subsequently be shared with state governments to follow up with individual cases.
</p>
<p>Once this data was collected by DoT, it was shared with Professor Kamakoti for further analysis and it was also made available on the COVID India Portal (S-3). In later meetings, it is clarified that the data has been aggregated at Cell Tower Level and anonymised to remove all mobile numbers and personal details but it is not clear at what stage such anonymisation took place.
</p>
<p>During one of the meetings, the DoT officials also offered to <em>""monitor the intrusion (persons with/without pass) and report the telephone numbers which do not have valid pass to States/Authorities."" </em>For this purpose, DoT was supposed to create a dashboard with latitude and longitude coordinates for all telephone numbers which could be piloted in a city.

<p>The Central Government has constituted several Empowered Groups under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 (DMA 2005) and powers have been delegated to these groups through orders which reference Sections 10(2)(h) and (i) of the Act. However, Section 10 does not permit any delegation of power and none of the provisions of DMA 2005 contain any reference to an “Empowered Group”. Therefore, the legality of this delegation of power upon Empowered Groups is questionable. The Government has constituted 11 Empowered Groups in total and the 9th Group has been specifically tasked with 'Technology and Data Management' and it is responsible for the creation and expansion of Aarogya Setu.
</p>
<p>The minutes of meetings of the 9th Empowered Group obtained through the RTI Act provide an insider view of the government's data collection projects during the COVID-19 pandemic which include the Aarogya Setu proximity exposure notification app, the ITIHAS hotspot mapping and prediction system, collection of cell tower location data by the Department of Telecom, and apps to input data regarding RT-PCR and antigen tests.
</p>
<h3>Aarogya Setu Mobile App</h3>
<p>The documents clearly state that there should be two-way sharing of data between Aarogya Setu and other databases which include the COVID India Portal (S-3) and the Ayushman Bharat System. These databases would also be connected to apps for RT-PCR and antigen tests to create a single source of truth. Here are some of the relevant portions of the minutes which descibe the relationship between different databases.
</p>
<p><strong>(i) Aarogya Setu and COVID India Portal (S-3)</strong>
</p>
<blockquote><em>""It was decided that that there should be integration of Bluetooth contact tracing data of Confirmed Positive cases from Aarogya Setu to S3 System. The contact tracing data should be visible to the district / state officers through S3 System interface enabling them to track and take necessary action for testing/ surveillance of these suspect cases. The action taken by the officers on this cases then should flow back to Aarogya setu to complete the cycle.""</em></blockquote>
<p><strong>(ii) Aarogya Setu and Ayushman Bharat</strong>
</p>
<blockquote><em>""Leads in the Aarogya Setu should be verified by Ayushman Bharat System and the filtered set of leads should be shared with states. Further feedback and action taken from field staff should flow back to Aarogya Setu.""</em><br /><br /><em>""The group was further informed that both Bluetooth and self assessment data (cleaned by Aarogya Bharat) are flowing from Aarogya Setu to S3 and vice-versa.""</em></blockquote>
<p>During the meetings, concerns were raised about sharing of health data between so many databases with Dr. Harpreet Singh, ICMR noting that <em>""lab data of Covid-19 is highly sensitive (health data) and at present there are many APIs for sharing of data with different stakeholders including NDMA, NHA &amp; others. There is need for Do’s and Don’ts with clear set of guidelines to secure the data."" </em>Government officials also seem to be aware of inaccurate reporting of a person's status by the Aarogya Setu app. For instance, during one of the meetings, Mr. RS Mani, DDG NIC highlighted <em>""the issue of false alarm (person released from hospital but status not updated)."" </em>
</p>
<p>The technical design choices of Aarogya Setu have been a subject of discussion among members of the 9th Empowered Group and officials from National Informatics Centre (NIC) were required to explain their reasons for adopting a static ID and not sharing the source code initially but these reasons are not mentioned in the minutes. NIC officials further pointed out that India could not use the Google-Apple API because it prohibited location tracking. NIC was also entrusted with the responsibility of handling the back end code of Aarogya Setu and it worked with pro bono volunteers from HP on this project.
</p>
<h3>ITIHAS Hotspot Mapping and Prediction System</h3>
<p>The minutes of meetings of the 9th Empowered Group contain several references to the ITIHAS system developed by Prof. Kamakoti, IIT Madras and NSAB for hotspot mapping and prediction. The forecasts from ITIHAS were to be integrated with the COVID India Portal (S3) and Prof. Kamakoti also made a presentation on findings from integration of ITIHAS with Aarogya Setu data. The documents also contain references to a project called 'Aarogya Rekha' being developed by Prof. Kamakoti which would be integrated with Aarogya Setu. Once this integration was done, states would then be asked to start using this tool for geographical marking of hot-spots.
</p>
<h3>Use of Cell Tower Location Data</h3>
<p>The minutes of meetings reveal that proposals to use cell tower location data to track the movement of persons was first considered in the context of the post lockdown exodus of migrants. It was decided that the Department of Telecom (DoT) would determine what kind of telecom data could be obtained about movement of migrants and this data could subsequently be shared with state governments to follow up with individual cases.
</p>
<p>Once this data was collected by DoT, it was shared with Professor Kamakoti for further analysis and it was also made available on the COVID India Portal (S-3). In later meetings, it is clarified that the data has been aggregated at Cell Tower Level and anonymised to remove all mobile numbers and personal details but it is not clear at what stage such anonymisation took place.
</p>
<p>During one of the meetings, the DoT officials also offered to <em>""monitor the intrusion (persons with/without pass) and report the telephone numbers which do not have valid pass to States/Authorities."" </em>For this purpose, DoT was supposed to create a dashboard with latitude and longitude coordinates for all telephone numbers which could be piloted in a city.

<p>The Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) for Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 is considering a revolutionary legislative proposal. To strengthen its process we have requested for two things. First, we have humbly requested the Joint Parliamentary Committee to work within its mandate and not be distracted by extraneous issues such as content takedowns of Kunal Kamra's tweets. Second, to provide a fuller perspective, we have asked the Joint Parliamentary Committee to consider more consultations with civil society who at present are only 10% of the total number of witnesses examined for depositions.
</p>
<h3>Mandate of the Joint Parliamentary Committee</h3>
<p>The Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) was constituted to examine The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (PDPB). According to <a href=""https://www.medianama.com/2020/11/223-jpc-twitter-kunal-kamra-tweets-sflc-in-letter/"">press reports</a>, the Committee recently questioned the social media platform Twitter over a recent tweet by comedian Kunal Kamra on which the Ld. the Attorney General of India has granted consent for initiation of contempt proceedings.
</p>
<p>Given the mandate and the volume of work to be considered by this Committee, such an action may fall beyond the ambit of the JPC. Further, the Standing Committee of Information Technology already exists and is more than capable of scrutinising such complex matters that involve issues of intermediary liability and content takedowns, it is better if such matter are left to the Standing Committee so that the JPC can fulfil the crucial task of providing a robust framework for the processing of data. This is a tremendous task and there are high public expectations that the JPC will act to safeguard user privacy through this path breaking legislation.
</p>
<p>Regardless, on the issue of takedowns, as at present there is an absence of a legal order requiring any such action as per the Shreya Singhal decision of the Supreme Court of India. We have witnessed such a situation Twitter itself before, as we noted in a joint letter endorsed by 243 lawyers when Twitter took down a tweet by Shri Prashant Bhushan (<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/joint-letter-to-twitter-about-removal-of-prashant-bhushan-tweets/"">link</a>).
</p>
<h3>Need for more diverse consultations</h3>
<p>The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 is an extremely important piece of legislation, and thus the holding of consultations with stakeholders is welcomed. However, as of 20th November 2020, of the 30 consultations held, 19 (63%) had been with industry bodies. Meanwhile, only 3 (10%) consultations have been held with a civil society organisation. Thus, we request the JPC that in the future it hold further consultations with academics, civil society, digital rights experts and organisations, and technologists.<br /></p>
<img src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/f5eY6rna5_0yy2-VxZxnkhILLhijtWigdMXwjvdm08s0PZ9nuB9_1Y99R8xkxKnnbm9aFT-V7zOWYx_0rXrMvEiv779C7e9UcfSfipmbaFVUtmjHLtQ4a-_UyPFDHsWgijpotPBl"" class=""kg-image"" style=""width:480px;"" alt=""f5eY6rna5_0yy2-VxZxnkhILLhijtWigdMXwjvdm08s0PZ9nuB9_1Y99R8xkxKnnbm9aFT-V7zOWYx_0rXrMvEiv779C7e9UcfSfipmbaFVUtmjHLtQ4a-_UyPFDHsWgijpotPBl"" /><p>Such groups can offer not only domain expertise but also a unique perspective on how best to regulate the processing of data beyond large technology companies or government departments. By helping the JPC understand how best to not only comprehensively protect the digital rights of the citizens but also ensure that social and economic justice are enshrined in our legislative framework, they can perform an important function and help build a more robust data protection law.

<p>Today we wrote to the Delhi Government urging against mandatory imposition of the Aarogya Setu app. Our alarm bells were rung by a circular issued by the Excise Department which directed licensed wholesale liquor vendors to ensure mandatory use of Aarogya Setu by every worker. In our representation, we have called upon the Delhi Government to withdraw the circular issued by the Excise Department and we have also sought issuance of an advisory to all departments clarifying that use of the Aarogya Setu app is purely voluntary and no person should be denied access to goods or services for failing to use the app.
</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The Aarogya Setu app was launched by the Ministry of Electronics &amp; Information Technology as a proximity exposure notification app on 02 April 2020 and it has been mired in controversy since its release. Concerns have been raised about misuse and breach of sensitive personal data collected by the app and legal experts have cautioned against deployment of such technologies in the absence of a data protection law in India. Public health experts have also<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/aarogya-setu-multi-domain-joint-statement/""> explained</a> why such apps cannot substitute on the ground contract tracing by healthcare workers and questioned the government's failure to explain why information available through existing databases is insufficient. Finally, technologists have <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/kerala-hc-hears-challenges-against-mandatory-imposition-of-aarogya-setu/"">warned</a> that Aarogya Setu relies on weak anonymization techniques which make its users susceptible to re-identification and <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/aarogya-setu-should-be-open-source-now/"">criticized</a> the lack of transparency surrounding the app's code and algorithms.
</p>
<h3>Stop the Voluntary-Mandatory Game</h3>
<p>The central government has repeatedly claimed that use of the Aarogya Setu app is voluntary but ground realities paint a very different picture. We have been closely tracking mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu by different institutions including <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/aarogya-setu-air-travel-survey/"">airports</a>, <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/aarogya-setu-delhi-district-courts/"">court complexes</a> and <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/aarogya-setu-rwas/"">resident welfare associations</a>. Most recently, our alarm bells were rung by a circular <a href=""https://www.livelaw.in/news-updates/delhi-government-makes-use-of-aarogya-setu-app-mandatory-for-wholesale-liquor-vends-staff-in-delhi-165270"">issued</a> by the Delhi Government's Department of Excise on 27 October 2020 which directed licensed wholesale liquor vendors to ensure <em>“mandatory use of Aarogya Setu app by every worker.” </em>The circular further stated that Bond Inspectors are required to ensure compliance with this direction and submit a certificate within 3 days.
</p>
<p>In our representation, we have called upon the Delhi Government to withdraw the circular issued by the Excise Department mandating use of the Aarogya Setu app by liquor store workers. We have also sought issuance of an advisory to all departments of the Government of NCT of Delhi clarifying that use of the Aarogya Setu app is purely voluntary and no person should be denied access to goods or services for failing to use the app. In support of these demands, we have highlighted the following concerns about legality and effectiveness of the Aarogya Setu app and explained how its mandatory imposition could lead to privacy violations and exclusion.
</p>
<h3>(IL)Legality</h3>
<p>Despite collecting sensitive health and location data of millions of Indians, the Aarogya Setu app lacks any legislative basis and powers have not been provided under any statutory instrument to mandate use of the app. In an <a href=""https://indianexpress.com/article/india/aarogya-setu-app-mandate-illegal-justice-b-n-srikrishna-6405535/"">interview</a> with the Indian Express, Retired Justice BN Srikrishna who headed the Committee on Data Protection constituted by the MeitY has endorsed this view and stated that making use of the Aarogya Setu app mandatory without enabling legislation is completely illegal. Mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu amounts to an infringement of fundamental rights of citizens because it could lead to privacy violations and exclusion, and therefore, such a measure must be supported by legislative authorization.
</p>
<h3>Inaccuracy and Ineffectiveness</h3>
<p>In addition to these legal concerns, mandatory imposition of the Aarogya Setu app may prove to be counterproductive at achieving its intended purpose of reducing COVID-19 transmission because of the inaccuracies inherent in app based contact tracing. Apps like Aarogya Setu rely on Bluetooth and GPS signals which cannot accurately estimate whether someone has been in close proximity (6 feet or less) of a COVID-19 infected person, and this can lead to a high number of false positives and false negatives. For instance, Bluetooth signals cannot recognize physical barriers such as walls and floors which make virus transmission impossible, and therefore, they may misidentify individuals as COVID-19 positive and send the authorities on a wild goose chase. Similarly, since Bluetooth based apps cannot account for surface to person transmission, they will also yield false negatives and provide a false sense of security to infected individuals.
</p>
<h3>Past Central Government Practice</h3>
<p>It should be noted that authorities of the central government have also recognized that use of the Aarogya Setu app cannot be made mandatory for workers. For instance, on 01 May 2020, the Ministry of Home Affairs had issued guidelines which made use of the Aarogya Setu app mandatory for all public and private sector employees and the head of an organization was responsible for ensuring 100% coverage of the app among all employees. After this decision was challenged before the Kerala High Court, MHA <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/aarogya-setu-victory/"">issued</a> revised guidelines on 17 May 2020 which encouraged use of the Aarogya Setu app on a ""best efforts"" basis but stopped short of making it mandatory.
</p>
<p>More recently on 22 August 2020, MeitY launched an Open API Service to enable employers to receive real-time information about the risk status of their employees, customers and users. However, the <a href=""https://openapi.aarogyasetu.gov.in/tandc"">Terms of Service</a> of the Open API Service clearly state that explicit consent of the user is necessary to access data collected by the Aarogya Setu app and alternative methods to avail a service must be provided to users who do not grant such consent.

<p>The latest Aadhaar Good Governance Rules notified in August 2020 legitimize function creep of the Aadhaar programme by allowing Aadhaar authentication for usage of digital platforms to ensure good governance, prevention of dissipation of social welfare benefits, and enablement of innovation and the spread of knowledge. These Rules come on the heels of amendements to the Aadhaar Act in 2019 which authorized use of Aadhaar by private parties, and these amendments have been challenged before the Supreme Court for violating the judgement in <em>K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India- Aadhaar 5J.</em> The cummulative impact of the Aadhaar Amendment Act 2019 and the Aadhaar Good Governance Rules 2020 is that there remain virtually no limitations on the use of Aadhaar authentication, which had earlier been restricted by the Supreme Court to only government entities and only for receipt of benefits and subsidies funded by the Consolidated Fund of India.
</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The Aadhaar project, which is a biometrics based national unique ID programme, was challenged before the Supreme Court of India in <em>K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India </em>in 2012 for violating individual privacy and causing exclusion. The subsequent litigation led to the question of whether the right to privacy is a fundamental right under the Indian Constitution being referred to a nine judge bench of the Supreme Court. In <em>K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India- Privacy 9J (2017 10 SCC 1)</em>, this nine judge bench unanimously held the privacy is a fundamental right and any restrictions upon this right must satisfy the proportionality standard.
</p>
<p>The constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act, 2016 was specifically addressed by a five judge bench of the Supreme Court in its subsequent judgement in <em>K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India- Aadhaar 5J (2019 1 SCC 1), </em>where the majority of judges upheld the constitutionality of the Act subject to certain limitations. Most importantly, the Supreme Court held that under Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act, an Aadhaar number cannot be mandated unless it involves seeking any subsidy, benefit or service for which the expenditure is incurred by the Consolidated Fund of India. The Court also struck down Section 57 of the Aadhaar Act to the extent it allowed use of Aadhaar authentication by private parties since it would lead to commercial exploitation of biometric and demographic information.
</p>
<p>Despite the Supreme Court finding that use of Aadhaar authentication by private parties is a dispropotionate invasion of privacy, the government soon proposed <a href=""https://uidai.gov.in/images/news/Amendment_Act_2019.pdf"">amendments</a> to the Aadhaar Act which would allow private parties to continue using Aadhaar to establish the identity of their users. Through the Aadhaar and Other Laws (Amendment) Act 2019, private entities were allowed to perform authentication through Aadhaar, if the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) is satisfied that it is: (i) compliant with certain standards of privacy and security, or (ii) permitted by law, or (iii) seeking authentication for a purpose specified by the central government in the interest of the State. The constitutionality of these amendments has been <a href=""https://indianexpress.com/article/india/sc-to-examine-validity-of-amended-law-allowing-private-firms-to-use-aadhaar-data-6132402/"">challenged</a> before the Supreme Court. Legal experts have also <a href=""https://thewire.in/law/in-striking-down-section-57-sc-has-curtailed-the-function-creep-and-financial-future-of-aadhaar"">explained</a> that Aadhaar authentication by private parties is inconsistent with the judgement in <em>K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India- Aadhaar 5J </em>since <em>""the majority upholds the Aadhaar Act on the premise that authentication is proportional only when used for state purposes to deliver services socio-economic benefits that are linked to human dignity""</em> and <em>""this analogy does not extend to private/commercial interests.""</em>
</p>
<h3>The Aadhaar Good Governance Rules, 2020</h3>
<p>The Aadhaar Authentication for Good Governance (Social Welfare, Innovation, Knowledge) Rules, 2020 were <a href=""https://uidai.gov.in//images/Aadhaar_Authentication_for_Good_Governance_Rules_2020.pdf"">notified</a> by the central government in August 2020. The Rules allow Aadhaar authentication by <em>“requesting entities”</em> in the <em>“interest of good governance, preventing leakage of public funds, promoting ease of living of residents and enabling better access to services for them”</em> for the enlisted purposes of:<br /><br />(a) usage of digital platforms to ensure good governance;<br />(b) prevention of dissipation of social welfare benefits; and<br />(c) enablement of innovation and the spread of knowledge.
</p>
<p>As per the rules, the authentication of Aadhaar by these requesting entities shall be on a voluntary basis but past experience raises serious concerns about Aadhaar being voluntary only on paper, and not in practice. Under the Rules, the relevant ministry or the department of the central government or the state government is required to prepare a proposal with a justification for the purpose for which it is seeking Aadhaar authentication. This proposal submitted to the Central Government will then be referred to UIDAI, and if UIDAI is satisfied that the proposal fulfills the enlisted purposes, the requesting entity shall be allowed to ask for Aadhaar authentication.
</p>
<p>The application form and the guidelines for submission of a proposal under the Rules mandate that the proposal should contain a <em>“brief description of the initiative or scheme highlighting the benefit that would accrue from its implementation”.</em> It further states that such benefits should be relatable to the specified purposes, for example, “<em>by facilitating participation, accountability, transparency, responsiveness, efficiency, effectiveness, equity, inclusion etc. which reduce or eliminate transaction costs, or promote ease of living of residents or enable better access to services for them</em>.” It also requires that the justification of the purpose should be brought out clearly, and the proposal should explain the “<em>ecosystem and the processes involved in the achievement or delivery of the benefit.”</em><br /></p>
<h3>A Free for All Privacy Nightmare</h3>
<p>The purposes for requesting Aadhaar authentication under the Aadhaar Good Governance Rules, 2020 are extremely vague and broad, and any government service can potentially fall within their scope. There are no parameters laid down for the UIDAI to determine whether Aadhaar authentication is 'necessary,' especially since the purposes themselves are so ambiguously wide and pale in comparison to the seriousness of the fundamental right to privacy. Therefore, in the absence of strict guidelines, all and sundry purposes can be sought to be justified. For example, the first chairman of the UIDAI has already <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-to-vaccinate-a-billion-people/story-9Tc4QzQpWNVGgSJQIBMfCP.html"">expressed</a> his views on the benefits of Aadhaar authentication for distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.
</p>
<p>Allowing such authentication runs the risk of being directly in the teeth of the Supreme Court judgment in <em>K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India- Aadhaar 5J </em>wherein it was categorically held that Aadhaar enrolment can be mandated only for receipt of ""<em>any subsidy, benefit or service under the welfare scheme of the government expenditure whereof is to be met from the Consolidated Fund of India."" </em>It should also be noted that when read together with the amendments to the Aadhaar Act in 2019, the Aadhaar Good Governance Rules 2020 create a risk of use of Aadhaar authentication by private parties for wide ranging purposes since Section 4(4) of the Aadhaar Act now allows any ""requesting entity"" to seek permission for Aadhaar authentication from UIDAI. Rule 3 of the Aadhaar Good Governance Rules requires proposals for Aadhaar authentication by requesting entities to be submitted by the government ministries or departments but there is no pre-condition that the requesting entity on whose behalf Aadhaar authentication is being sought should also be a government entity.
</p>
<p>The dependence on Aadhaar authentication to prevent dissipation of benefits has led to the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/indias-vast-biometric-program-was-supposed-to-end-corruption-but-the-neediest-may-be-hit-hardest/2018/03/24/bb212a86-289c-11e8-a227-fd2b009466bc_story.html"">exclusion</a> of many people who are the rightful beneficiaries of these entitlements, and such exclusion is counterproductive if the goal is improving access to government services. A study conducted by the <a href=""https://www.nber.org/papers/w26744"">Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab </a>in Jharkhand found that at least 88% of the ration cards that were cancelled, were in fact genuine claims. There have also been <a href=""https://www.epw.in/engage/article/aadhaar-failures-food-services-welfare"">several instances</a> of people facing practical difficulties in getting Aadhaar numbers and accessing welfare schemes because of lack of awareness, lack of infrastructure, immobility due to illness etc.
</p>
<p>From the very inception of Aadhaar, the government has claimed that its biometric authentication technology helps prevent identity fraud and ensures that benefits only go to the deserving. However, as economists have pointed out, there is <a href=""https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/uidai-aadhaar-card-the-real-beneficiary-4684994/"">no reliable evidence</a> backing claims of widespread identity fraud and Aadhaar's ability to plug these leakages. Further, an RTI query revealed that 99.97 percent of people who enrolled for an Aadhaar number did it on the basis of existing identification documents, so lack of identification documents is clearly not the main cause of exclusion from welfare programmes.
</p>
<p>To conclude, as Rethink Aadhaar has incisively noted in this excellent <a href=""https://rethinkaadhaar.in/blog/2020/8/7/new-aadhaar-rules-for-good-governance-are-constitutionally-impermissible"">post</a>, the Aadhaar Good Governance Rules 2020 are just old wine in a new bottle. The purpose of subordinate legislation is to be more operationally specific, by clarifying ambiguities. However, the Rules come across as an attempt to sidestep the Supreme Court judgement in <em>K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India Aadhaar-5J </em>by expanding the scope of the Aadhaar project through the trappings of vague rules and guidelines.

<p>On Monday, IFF wrote to the National Health Authority as part of the consultation being conducted for the National Digital Health Mission’s Health Data Management Policy. Our primary demands are that deployment of any digital health ID programme must be preceded by (a) enactment of general and sectoral data protection laws by the Parliament of India; and (b) meaningful public consultation which reaches out to vulnerable groups which face the greatest privacy risks.
</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The public consultation being conducted by the National Health Authority for the National Digital Health Mission’s Health Data Management Policy (Draft Policy) has been the subject of intense controversy. Earlier this month, a petition was also filed before the Delhi High Court by Dr. Satendra Singh, a noted disability rights activist, which raised concerns about the unreasonably short deadline for submission of feedback at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and highlighted how the existing process excludes persons with disabilities, non-English speakers and people without internet access (Read more <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/ndhm-data-policy-delhi-hc/"">here</a>).
</p>
<p>Subsequent to the hearing before the Delhi High Court, the National Health Authority announced that the deadline for submission of feedback would be extended till 21 September 2020 and people could send their feedback through offline modes such as post or courier as well. It also indicated that it was undertaking measures to make the consultation process accessible for persons with disabilities in accordance with existing government policy. However, despite these concessions, the consultation process still remained violative of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016, Official Languages Act 1963 and the Pre-Legislative Consultation Policy 2014 (Read more <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/ndhm-data-policy-representation/"">here</a>).<br /></p>

<p>In our submission to the National Health Authority, we have highlighted five key legal and technical concerns associated with the Draft Policy and the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM) more generally.
</p>
<p><strong>(i) Lack of data protection legislation</strong>
</p>
<p>The submission emphasizes on the importance of an underlying legislative framework by relying on standards established by international bodies such as the <a href=""https://www.who.int/goe/publications/legal_framework_web.pdf"">World Health Organization (WHO)</a> and the <a href=""https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/JC2640_nationalhealthidentifiers_en.pdf"">United Nations HIV/AIDS Programme (UNAIDS)</a> for national digital ID projects. Our submission notes that ensuring health data privacy requires legislation at three levels- comprehensive laws, sectoral laws and informal rules. Applying this framework to India, we demonstrate that India neither has a comprehensive law since the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 is still pending in Parliament, nor does it have a sectoral law like the proposed but yet to be enacted Digital Information Security in Healthcare Act, 2018. Viewed through this lens, the Draft Policy can at best be considered a set of informal rules which lack any statutory basis.
</p>
<p>In addition to WHO, UNAIDS has also emphasized that national level privacy legislation is necessary to address privacy concerns associated with national health IDs. The UNAIDS Report further states that prior to deployment of any national health ID programme, <em>“it is essential to engage with people living with HIV and members of key populations and other vulnerable groups, including sex workers, men who have sex with men, people who use drugs and people with disabilities, so potential concerns such as access to cards and care, risk of unlawful access and use by law enforcement agencies and others can be identified and addressed.”</em> The consultation process for the Draft Policy which has only been published on the internet in English and which was not accessible for persons with disabilities clearly falls short of these standards established by UNAIDS.<br /></p>
<p><strong>(ii) <em>De facto</em> mandatory nature of Digital Health ID Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>As reported by various media publications, registration for a health ID under the NDHM may be voluntary on paper but it is being made mandatory in practice by hospital administrators and heads of departments. As doctors from Chandigarh quoted in the <a href=""https://caravanmagazine.in/health/doctors-in-chandigarh-compelled-to-register-for-the-voluntary-national-health-id"">Caravan</a> note <em>“It feels like strong-arming really...There is a hierarchy and we have to follow orders, even if they don’t give it in writing, if your HOD asks you to register you have to register” </em>and <em>“They keep asking to give constant updates on how many members from our department have registered with the health ID, and so everyone has to ensure they have registered otherwise the HOD will know, and who knows what the repercussions will be.”</em>
</p>
<p>The <em>de facto</em> mandatory nature of the digital health ID programme under NDHM can be addressed only if it supported by an underlying legislation which clearly places a bar on denial of healthcare services because of lack of a digital health ID, and prescribes strict penalties for erring government officials who make use of such health IDs mandatory.<br /></p>
<p><strong>(iii) Linkage of Aadhaar with Digital Health ID</strong>
</p>
<p>The use of Aadhaar number for the purposes of authentication of identity at the time of registration raises serious privacy concerns about linkage of a person’s health data with other databases, and it increases the likelihood of the National Digital Health Ecosystem being connected with systems beyond the health sector.
</p>
<p>Additionally, the non-inclusion of official identifiers like Aadhaar number within the definition of sensitive personal data under the Draft Policy is inconsistent with the government’s own Personal Data Protection Bill and may lead to inadequate protection being provided to Aadhaar details shared by participants in NDHM.<br /></p>
<p><strong>(iv) Risk of re-identification of anonymized data</strong>
</p>
<p>The Draft Policy does not adequately address concerns about reidentification of de-identified or anonymized health data which is now widely understood to be a real threat. For instance, researchers have been able to <a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2289850"">re-identify</a> 43% of known patients by matching de-identified data sets against news reports. Researchers have also <a href=""https://dataprivacylab.org/projects/identifiability/paper1.pdf"">found</a> that 87% of the population in the United States can be uniquely identified based on only three characteristics - ZIP, gender, date of birth - and proven that any data set which includes these highly identifying characteristics cannot not be considered anonymized.
</p>
<p><strong>(v) Threat of data breaches</strong>
</p>
<p>Executives in the healthcare sector have <a href=""https://health.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/policy/why-data-protection-is-crucial-for-successful-implementation-of-national-digital-health-mission/77834185"">recognized</a> the cybersecurity risks posed by the NDHM. Further, India has a past record of breaches of sensitive personal data like financial information. For instance, in 2016, 3.2 million debit cards were <a href=""https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/banks-recall-3-2-mn-debit-cards-as-data-security-compromised-116102001226_1.html"">recalled</a> by various banks due to a data breach. Any similar leak of sensitive health data collected as part of NDHM would cause severe and irreparable harm to millions of citizens which cannot be quantified or compensated in monetary terms. For this reason, it is essential that independent technical experts are provided more time to thoroughly scrutinize the National Digital Health Ecosystem’s technical design and there should be full disclosure of all information that is necessary to conduct such an independent evaluation.

<p><a href=""https://world.time.com/2013/06/30/in-india-prism-like-surveillance-slips-under-the-radar/#ixzz2YpWhRsrB"">The Centralised Monitoring System (CMS) is an ambitious surveillance system that monitors text messages, social-media engagement and phone calls on landlines and cell phones, among other communications.</a> It has been set up by the Centre for Development of Telematics (C-DOT) and is operated by the Telecom Enforcement Resource and Monitoring (TERM) cells under the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). Like the <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/watch-the-watchmen-part-1-the-national-intelligence-grid/"">NATGRID</a>, the CMS has also been developed by the government to strengthen the security structure of the country.<br /></p>
<h1>History</h1>
<p>Post the 26/11 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, a need was felt for greater coordination between law enforcement and security agencies. CMS is one of the multiple projects that the government initiated in 2009 in order to fill the gaps in India’s internal security structure. The project was <a href=""https://cis-india.org/internet-governance/blog/india-central-monitoring-system-something-to-worry-about"">approved by the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) on 16th June 2011 and the pilot project was completed by 30th September 2011.</a><br /></p>
<p>The estimated budget for the project was <a href=""http://loksabhaph.nic.in/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=150407&amp;lsno=15"">400 crore INR</a> however the actual cost of the project is said to be higher.<br /></p>
<p>The project, which was first envisaged in 2009, was delayed multiple times and finally operationalised in <a href=""https://www.firstpost.com/india/telecom-central-monitoring-system-in-10-circles-by-december-914389.html"">2013</a> however the implementation is being done in <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/Politics/CdtkNPkBf5umcVrTOYZ4GP/Govt-setting-up-central-monitoring-system-to-intercept-data.html"">phases</a>.<br /></p>
<h1>What is CMS?</h1>
<p>CMS aims to automate the process of lawful interception &amp; monitoring of telecommunications. Before CMS, law enforcement agencies had to approach individual telecom service providers (TSP) for interception of communications of targets such as suspected terrorists or criminals. However, CMS aims to remove or bypass the middle man, i.e., TSPs, and allow the law enforcement agency to monitor the target through a central system.<br /></p>
<p>In order to bypass the TSPs, the CMS was provided unfettered access to the existing Lawful Interception Systems (LIS). LIS was a <a href=""https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Police-lack-technology-tools-to-connect-the-call-dots/article14016306.ece"">frequently used uniform platform for law enforcement agencies to track and gather cell and internet records.</a> All service providers in the country were required to have LIS installed in their premises. Interception through LIS happened by interception requests which were made by law enforcement agencies to the Nodal Officers of the TSPs. However, under the CMS, the TSPs were made to integrate the LIS with <a href=""https://cis-india.org/internet-governance/blog/india-central-monitoring-system-something-to-worry-about"">Interception Store &amp; Forward (ISF) servers</a>. These servers are connected to the Regional Monitoring Centres (RMC) of CMS allowing them direct access to all intercepted data of the TSPs. These RMCs can be accessed directly by any participating law enforcement agency through the CMS, surpassing the need to contact TSPs and essentially automating the entire process. <a href=""https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1556&amp;context=law_globalstudies"">Whereas before the government had to request that user information be monitored and turned over to the authorities, under CMS the Indian government can “tap into communications at will without telling the service providers.”</a><br /></p>
<p>On August 7, 2013, in response to a parliamentary question, the Minister of State in the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology Milind Deora <a href=""http://loksabhaph.nic.in/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=143964&amp;lsno=15"">stated</a> that the envisaged salient features of CMS are as follows:
</p>
<ol><li>Direct Electronic Provisioning of target number by a Government agency without any manual intervention from Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) on a secured network, thus enhancing the secrecy level and quick provisioning of target.
</li><li>Central and regional database which will help Central and State level Law Enforcement Agencies in Interception and Monitoring.
</li><li>Analysis of Call Data Records (CDR) to help in establishing linkage between anti-social /anti-national elements.
</li><li>Research and Development (R&amp;D) in related fields for continuous up-gradation of the CMS.<br /></li></ol><p>The participating law enforcement agencies of the CMS <a href=""https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/dec/24/big-brother-is-here-amid-snooping-row-govt-report-says-monitoring-system-practically-complete-1915866.html"">are</a>:
</p>
<ol><li>Intelligence Bureau (IB)
</li><li>Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)
</li><li>Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI)
</li><li>Research &amp; Analysis Wing (RAW)
</li><li>National Investigation Agency (NIA)
</li><li>Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB)
</li><li>Enforcement Directorate (ED)
</li><li>Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT)
</li><li>Directorate of Signal Intelligence
</li><li>Commissioner of Police, Delhi<br /><br /></li></ol><h1>What are the privacy concerns surrounding CMS?</h1>
<p>Interception through CMS will thus be done by these agencies directly without any need to approach individual service providers.
</p>
<p>On August 7, 2013, in response to a parliamentary question the Minister of State in the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology Milind Deora stated:
</p>
<blockquote>“To take care of the privacy of citizens, lawful interception and monitoring is governed by the <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1445510/"">section 5(2) of Indian Telegraph Act, 1885</a> read with <a href=""https://dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/march2007.pdf"">rule 419A of Indian Telegraph (Amendment) Rules, 2007</a> wherein oversight mechanism exists in form of review committee under chairmanship of the Cabinet Secretary at Central Government level and Chief Secretary of the State at the State Government level. The same mechanism is applicable for the interception under the CMS Project also. Additionally, there is an inbuilt mechanism of check and balance as Security Agencies/Law Enforcement Agencies cannot provision the target and the provisioning agency cannot see the content.”</blockquote>
<p>In the absence of a data protection law in India and without any intermediaries in place, the process through which interception would be done under the CMS lacks transparency. This means that the general public will not know if and when a person’s data has been intercepted. It would also be difficult to ascertain whether there was a valid reason for this interception. A practice of mass surveillance could be adopted wherein large groups of people have their data intercepted without a valid reason. Since these interception authorisations will be done by the government agencies internally, there will be no way of knowing about them and whether they were done for a valid reason, let alone questioning or challenging them.<br /></p>
<p>The prevailing legal regime regarding privacy can thus be reduced to the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in <em>Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India </em>(2017 10 SCC 1) which states that any justifiable intrusion by the State into people’s right to privacy, which is protected under Article 21 of the Constitution, must conform to certain thresholds which include legality, necessity, proportionality and procedural safeguards.<br /></p>
<p>The threshold of legality requires that the intrusion must take place a defined regime of law i.e. there must be an anchoring legislation, with a clear set of provisions. The CMS does not have any anchoring legislation and thus fails to meet this threshold.<br /></p>
<p>The threshold of procedural safeguards requires that there is an appropriate independent institutional mechanism, with in-built procedural safeguards aligned with standards of procedure established by law which are just, fair and reasonable to prevent abuse. As stated above, the CMS has an in-built mechanism of check and balances. While we can appreciate the spirit of this measure, it is not sufficient to quell any privacy concerns as there is no independent oversight. Independent oversight is necessary to ensure that invalid interception requests are not authorised by law enforcement agencies.<br /></p>
<h1>Surveillance laws in India and a need for reform</h1>
<p>The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, deals with interception of calls under <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1445510/"">Section 5(2)</a>, and the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000, deals with interception of data under <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1439440/"">Section 69</a>. <a href=""https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/what-are-the-surveillance-laws-in-india/article29993602.ece"">Under both laws, only the government, under certain circumstances, is permitted to conduct surveillance.</a> Security of the state is a common reason under both the provisions pursuant to which the government can issue orders for surveillance. However, it was felt that these provisions lack procedural safeguards which would ensure that they are used by the government in a justified manner. Thus, the government enacted specific rules [ <a href=""https://dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/march2007.pdf"">rule 419A of Indian Telegraph (Amendment) Rules, 2007</a> and the <a href=""https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Information%20Technology%20%28Procedure%20and%20Safeguards%20for%20Interception%2C%20Monitoring%20and%20Decryption%20of%20Information%29%20Rules%2C%202009.pdf"">Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Interception, Monitoring and Decryption of Information) Rules, 2009</a>] under which orders for interceptions of communication can only be issued by the Secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs and orders for the interception, monitoring or decryption of any information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer resource can only be issued by the Union Home Secretary or State Secretaries in charge of the Home Departments. However, as can be seen above the Government has now <a href=""https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/are-indias-laws-on-surveillance-a-threat-to-privacy/article25844250.ece"">authorised</a> upto ten agencies for purposes of interception, monitoring and decryption of any information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer resource under the IT act.<br /></p>
<p>The present surveillance architecture in India is thus too weak and can be seen to be prone to <a href=""https://world.time.com/2013/06/30/in-india-prism-like-surveillance-slips-under-the-radar/#ixzz2YpWhRsrB"">mass surveillance</a>. Hopes were set on the upcoming Personal Data Protection Bill to provide some level of protection however as the draft stands currently, Clause 35 of the Bill empowers the Central Government to exempt by an order, ‘any agency’ of the government from all or any provisions of the data protection law if it is in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the state, friendly relations, public order and to prevent incitement to the commission of an offence.<br /></p>
<p>It is our <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/essential-features-of-a-rights-respecting-data-protection-law/"">view</a> that these existing exemptions are too vague and broad and must be narrowly tailored. A complete chapter on surveillance reform needs to be inserted in the present PDP Bill. Government agencies responsible for carrying out surveillance and interception as part of their law enforcement functions must be clearly identified, notified, and bound by the provisions of the Bill. In addition to a stronger data protection law, India also needs a separate legislation to regulate surveillance by the government to ensure that state sponsored mass surveillance does not become a reality in India.<br /></p>

<p>We wrote to the Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare and the National Health Authority after the Delhi High Court directed the government to decide concerns surrounding the consultation for the National Digital Health Mission's Health Data Management Policy in accordance with existing laws, rules and policies. The representation was sent by Dr. Satendra Singh, the petitioner before the Delhi High Court and it highlights how the consultation process is still in violation of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016, Official Languages Act 1963 and the Pre-Legislative Consultation Policy 2014. The representation urges the government to re-calculate 30 days for submission of feedback after implementing recommended changes and to extend the deadline.
</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>On 03 September 2020, the Delhi High Court heard a writ petition filed by Dr. Satendra Singh, a doctor and noted disability activist, which challenged the consultation process for the National Digital Health Mission's Health Data Management Policy. The petition raised concerns about the unreasonably short deadline for submission of feedback at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and highlighted how the existing process excludes persons with disabilities, non-English speakers and people without internet access. In its order, the Delhi High Court directed the government to consider the petitioner's representation in accordance with laws, rules and policies, and further noted that inadequate public consultation could be raised as a ground if the Draft Policy was challenged after its notification (Read more <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/ndhm-data-policy-delhi-hc/"">here</a>).
</p>
<p>Subsequent to the hearing before the Delhi High Court, the National Health Authority announced that the deadline for submission of feedback would be extended till 21 September 2020 and people could send their feedback through offline modes such as post or courier as well. It also indicated that it was undertaking measures to make the consultation process accessible for persons with disabilities in accordance with existing government policy.
</p>
<h3>What problems remain?</h3>
<p>The representation acknowledges the steps taken by the government to improve the consultation process but explains that several statutory obligations and policy commitments have still not been complied with.
</p>
<ol><li><strong>Violation of Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016</strong><br />Section 46 of the RPWD Act provides all government and private websites a time period of two years to make information and communication technology accessible to persons with disabilities in the manner required under Section 42 of the RPWD Act and Rule 15(c) of the RPWD Rules. Since the RPWD Rules were notified on 15 June 2017, the deadline to make all government and private websites accessible was 15 June 2019.<br />Yet in August 2020, National Health Authority introduced an inaccessible measure in the online form for the consultation for the Draft Policy on its website. The online form requires the user to fill an image CAPTCHA which is inaccessible for persons with visual impairment, who are protected under Clause 1(B) of the Schedule to RPWD Act. Further, an alternative option of making submissions by email has not been provided either. While submissions can be sent via post or courier, this is significantly more cumbersome and cannot be the only alternative available to persons with visual impairments who have a statutorily guaranteed right to access government websites on an equal basis. The use of image CAPTCHA in the absence of any accessible alternatives also violates Clause 6.6.3 of the Guidelines for Indian Government Websites issued under Rule 15(c) of the RPWD Rules.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Violation of Official Languages Act, 1963</strong><br />At present, the Draft Policy is only available in English, and translated versions are not available for any of the 22 languages recognized under the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution. At the bare minimum, the Draft Policy must be translated to Hindi since there is a statutory obligation under Section 4(i) of the Official Languages Act, 1963 to publish all resolutions, general orders, rules, notifications, administrative or other reports or press communiques issued by the Central Government in both English and Hindi.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Inconsistency with Pre-Legislative Consultation Policy, 2014</strong><br />The Draft Policy has been published on the official NDHM website but there is a need to give it wide publicity through print and electronic media to reach citizens who may not have access to the internet. This approach is also supported by the Pre-Legislative Consultation Policy issued by the Ministry of Law &amp; Justice which recognized the importance of dissemination of information through mediums besides the internet as well. While the government has allowed citizens to submit feedback via post and courier to account for the Digital Divide, there is a need to proactively disseminate information about the consultation through traditional media as well. The Pre-Legislative Consultation Policy also requires the government to provide the public at least 30 days to submit feedback. In the present case, the consultation was publicly announced through a press release on 26 August 2020 and the deadline for submission of feedback is 21 September 2020 despite the prevailing COVID-19 crisis in the country.
</li></ol><h3>Recommendations</h3>
<p>In order to address the above mentioned problems in the consultation process, the representation makes the following five demands:
</p>
<ul><li>Modify or remove the image CAPTCHA present in the online form for submission for feedback using output modes for different types of sensory perception to accommodate different disabilities (visual impairment as well as deaf-blindness). Examples of multimodal options empowering choice to people with varying disabilities include image CAPTCHA, audio CAPTCHA, text-based logic CAPTCHA, SMS OTP CAPTCHA, e-mail OTP with click link to verify CAPTCHA.
</li><li>Provide an email address for submission of feedback, as has been done with previous policy consultations for the Drugs and Clinical Trial Rules 2019, Cosmetic Rules 2018, Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 and Report on Non-Personal Data Governance Framework.
</li><li>Translate and publish the Draft Health Data Management Policy in Hindi at the very least, and in other languages recognized under the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution as far as possible.
</li><li>Widely publicize the consultation through print and electronic media.
</li><li>Re-calculate 30 days for submission of feedback from the date of implementing the above mentioned changes and extend the deadline for the consultation.

<p>Today, i.e. 03 September 2020, the Delhi High Court heard a petition which challenged the public consultation process for the National Digital Health Mission's Health Data Management Policy. The petition raised concerns about the unreasonably short deadline for submission of feedback at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and highlighted how the existing process excludes persons with disabilities, non-English speakers and people without internet access. After hearing the petitioner's counsel, the Delhi High Court directed the government to consider the petitioner's representation and noted that inadequate public consultation could be raised as a ground if the Draft Policy was challenged after its notification.
</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The National Digital Health Mission (NDHM) was announced by the Prime Minister on the 74th Independence Day, and it envisages the creation of a National Digital Health Ecosystem with six key features- HealthID, DigiDoctor, Health Facility Registry, Personal Health Records, Telemedicine, and e-Pharmacy. A government press release describes NDHM as: <em>“Every Indian citizen will get a Health ID which will be a repository of all health-related information, of a person, such as medical tests, previous prescriptions, diagnosis, treatments, all historical health records”</em> and that <em>“private stakeholders’ will have an equal opportunity to integrate with these building blocks and create their own products for the market.”</em>
</p>
<p>Within the first two week of its launch on 15 August 2020, health IDs were created for 55,700 individuals under NDHM. After launching the programme in six Union Territories, the National Health Authority issued a press release on 26 August 2020 announcing the public consultation for the Draft Health Data Management Policy for NDHM and the deadline to submit feedback was 03 September 2020. On 31 August 2020, the deadline was extended by another week till 5:00 PM on 10 September 2020.
</p>
<h3>Petition before Delhi High Court</h3>
<p>A writ petition was filed by Dr. Satendra Singh, a doctor and noted disability rights activist, before the Delhi High Court earlier this week which challenged the consultation process for the Draft Health Data Management Policy. The petition outlined four major problems with the consultation process which undermined minimum requirements for public participation in democratic decision-making.
</p>
<ol><li><em><em><em><strong>Short 15 day timeline</strong></em></em></em><br />The consultation is being conducted in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic when functioning of individuals and organizations is disrupted and people are finding it difficult to organize, collaborate, hold meetings etc. Analysis of the Draft Policy also requires multidisciplinary expertise in computer science, law, public health and medical ethics. Therefore, people need more time to consult and confer with experts and other stakeholders. In particular, healthcare workers are fully engrossed in management of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is unreasonable to expect them to analyze and evaluate such a complex policy document within 15 days.<br /></li><li><em><em><em><strong>Inaccessibility for persons with visual impairments</strong></em></em></em><br />In order to participate in the public consultation, an individual is required to fill the form available on NDHM’s website. At present, the form cannot be filled by persons with visual disabilities since the user must fill a CAPTCHA prior to submitting their response. A CAPTCHA cannot be read by screen reading software used by persons with visual disabilities, and in the absence of any alternatives, its use violates rights guaranteed under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. Persons with disabilities have distinct healthcare related rights and are specifically-impacted stakeholders to NDHM. Therefore, the consultation process must be conducted in a manner that satisfies the government's statutory obligation to provide reasonable accomodation under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.<br /></li><li><em><em><em><strong>Online-only mode of engagement</strong></em></em></em><br />The consultation process is entirely online even though only 54% of the Indian population has access to the internet. This is contrary to the 2014 Pre-Legislative Consultation Policy, which recognized that every draft for consultation must be published not just on the internet but also by other means.<br /></li><li><em><em><em><strong>English</strong></em></em><strong>-</strong><em><em><strong>only mode of engagement</strong></em></em></em><br />The Health Data Management Policy is only available in English and translated versions are not available for any of the 22 official languages recognized under the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution.The lack of translated versions will massively undermine the ability of the public to participate in the consultation process since census data suggests that around 13 crore people in India speak English, which is barely 10% of the country’s total population.
</li></ol><h3>What happened during the hearing?</h3>
<p>The writ petition filed by Dr. Satendra Singh was listed before a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan of the Delhi High Court. During the hearing, the bench indicated that it could not go into the matter at this stage, especially since there was no statutory obligation to hold public consultation. It should be noted that NDHM and the Draft Policy do not have any basis in legislation, and therefore, a statutory obligation to hold public consultation is not possible. However, despite this, the Court directed the government to consider the petitioner's representation sent on 29 August 2020 in accordance with existing laws, rules and policies. The Court also noted that the issue of lack of meaningful public consultation could be raised as a ground of challenge if the Draft Policy is challenged on substantive grounds after its notification.

<p>The National Intelligence Grid, better known as NATGRID, is an integrated IT solution which would allow user agencies to access data gathered from various databases such as credit and debit cards, tax, telecom, immigration, airlines and railway tickets, passports, driving licenses among others. It is being developed as a measure to help security agencies such as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Research &amp; Analysis Wing (RAW) etc. in tackling crime and terror threats in the country.<br /></p>
<h1><strong>History</strong></h1>
<p><a href=""https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/archive/comment/tackling-terror-with-smart-seamless-grid-847286"">Security is a state subject and the police forces are controlled by the state governments, thereby giving the states the exclusive power to legislate with respect to the police system and exercise full administrative control over the police. </a>Post the 26/11 terror attacks in Mumbai, a need was felt for facilitating higher coordination between the intelligence and law-enforcement agencies. <a href=""https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/all-you-need-to-know-about-natgrid-and-its-new-ceo-ashok-patnaik-116071400134_1.html"">NATGRID aims to mitigate a vital deficiency — lack of real time information, which was considered to be one of the major hurdles in detecting US terror suspect David Headley's movement across the country during his multiple visits between 2006 and 2009.</a><br /></p>
<p>NATGRID was conceptualized by then Home Minister P. Chidambaram in 2009, in a bid to revamp India’s internal security structure and create a centralized database which can be accessed easily by intelligence agencies at the national level. <a href=""http://loksabhaph.nic.in/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=125912&amp;lsno=15"">NATGRID was set up as an attached Office of the Ministry of Home Affairs with effect from December 1, 2010. Further, Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) has “in-principle” approved the Detailed Project Report (DPR) of NATGRID on June 6, 2011. Planning Commission also accorded its ‘In Principle’ approval to the project on July 8, 2011, as a ‘Central Plan Scheme’ under MHA from 2011-12.</a><br /></p>
<p>The <a href=""http://loksabhaph.nic.in/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=29595&amp;lsno=16"">year-wise break-up of expenditure</a> in setting up NATGRID, which was disclosed in Parliament on March 1, 2016 is as under:<br /></p>

<p>However, the proposed solution has been on hold since then and has not been launched in the ten years since. On November 19, 2019, in <a href=""http://loksabhaph.nic.in/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=6705&amp;lsno=17"">response</a> to a parliamentary question the Minister of State for Home Affairs G. Kishan Reddy stated that the project has developed application software for Proof of Technology (POT) and NATGRID is planned to go live on December 31, 2020.<br /></p>
<h1><strong>What is NATGRID?</strong></h1>
<p>The <a href=""http://loksabhaph.nic.in/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=22670&amp;lsno=16"">NATGRID</a> is conceived to be a framework which will leverage Information Technology to connect approved User Agencies (security/law enforcement) with designated Data providers (Airlines, Banks, SEBI, Railway, Telecom etc.) with a view to enhance the country’s counter- terrorism capability. The platform envisages approved operating procedures and oversight mechanisms to facilitate access between users and providers to enable them to analyze and disseminate information/intelligence for synergizing efforts to counter terrorism related activity.<br /></p>
<p>The proposed <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NmHg0h9kX6OCogicsft1y4XBkkMFuPsH/view?usp=sharing"">user agencies</a> of the NATGRID are:
</p>
<ol><li>Intelligence Bureau (IB),
</li><li>Research &amp; Analysis Wing (R&amp;AW),
</li><li>Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI),
</li><li>Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI),
</li><li>Enforcement Directorate (ED),
</li><li>Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU),
</li><li>Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT),
</li><li>Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC),
</li><li>Directorate General of Central Excise and Intelligence (DGCEI) and
</li><li>Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB).<br /></li></ol><p>No state agency is included in the proposed user agencies for NATGRID.<br /></p>
<p><a href=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/natgrid-to-get-pan-taxpayer-data-access/articleshow/59270998.cms"">In the first phase, these 10 user agencies and 21 service providers will be connected. Later, about 1,950 additional organisations will be linked in the subsequent phases.</a> These service or data providers will provide access to data related to immigration entry and exit, banking and financial transactions, telecommunications including mobile numbers, vehicle numbers, passport details and, in later phases, train and air ticketing details.<br /></p>
<p>It has been <a href=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/natgrid-to-get-pan-taxpayer-data-access/articleshow/59270998.cms"">reported</a> that NATGRID will also have access to the Income Tax Department's PAN records and individual taxpayers' data. “According to an order issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes, the department will share 'bulk information', starting from the Permanent Account Number (PAN) to the taxpayer's name and all the individual data that it captures like father's name, gender, date of birth, photograph and signature or thumb impression. The department will also share with the National Intelligence Grid (NATGRID) all information available in the department's database regarding residential and office addresses and phone and mobile numbers of all the taxpayers.”<br /></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/natgrid-wants-to-link-social-media-accounts-to-central-database/article29402252.ece"">Reports</a> have also suggested that the government could link social media accounts of individuals with NATGRID as well. However, this move has faced severe resistance from the intelligence agencies, whose officials fear that linking the social media accounts to sensitive government data could expose the system to “trojan attacks.”<br /></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/natgrid-to-use-big-data-analytics-to-track-suspects-113122900191_1.html"">NATGRID will utilise Big Data and Analytics to study huge amounts of data generated from 21 data sources of various intelligence and enforcement agencies to analyse events in order to get a better picture as well as to trail suspects.</a><br /></p>
<p>NATGRID is currently headed by IAS officer Ashish Gupta. There are around 70 personnel, drawn from both the government and private sectors, in NATGRID. The main office complex for NATGRID is being constructed in New Delhi with a data recovery centre in Bengaluru.<br /></p>
<h1><strong>What could go wrong?</strong></h1>
<p>On March 13, 2012, the then Minister of State for Home Affairs Jitendra Singh in <a href=""http://loksabhaph.nic.in/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=116617&amp;lsno=15"">response</a> to a parliamentary question acknowledged that the government is cognizant of the privacy concerns surrounding NATGRID. He further stated that, “NATGRID’s security framework has been designed to protect secrecy and privacy of information within the NATGRID system. The extant legal regime regarding privacy ipso-facto applies to NATGRID.”<br /></p>
<p>The Right to Information Act, 2000 which aims to bring transparency and accountability to government authorities contains a provision which exempts intelligence agencies from its purview under <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1767825/"">S.24(2)</a> of the Act. <a href=""http://loksabhaph.nic.in/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=6705&amp;lsno=17"">NATGRID is exempted from the RTI Act, 2005</a> vide <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sWp9q2MXuBxNUT3j_E2GHsAY_d1IdOEw/view"">Gazette of India Notification No. GSR 442 (E) dated 09.06.2011 issued by DOP&amp;T.</a><br /></p>
<p>In addition to being exempt from the RTI Act, NATGRID is also being developed and deployed in the absence of a data protection law in India. Since NATGRID aims to collate data from various sources to create profiles of people to track for criminal activity, it is necessary that data protection measures be put in place to ensure that NATGRID does not violate its mandate by suffering from function creep. “Function creep” occurs when information is used for a purpose that is not the original specified purpose. In the absence of data protection measures and by being exempt from disclosures under the RTI Act, NATGRID presents the very obvious danger of becoming a tool for state-sponsored mass surveillance.<br /></p>
<p>The prevailing legal regime regarding privacy can thus be reduced to the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in <em>Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India </em>(2017 10 SCC 1) which states that any justifiable intrusion by the State into people’s right to privacy, which is protected under Article 21 of the Constitution, must conform to certain thresholds which include legality, necessity, proportionality and procedural safeguards.<br /></p>
<p>The threshold of legality requires that the intrusion must take place a defined regime of law i.e. there must be an anchoring legislation, with a clear set of provisions. However, in <a href=""http://loksabhaph.nic.in/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=147770&amp;lsno=15"">response</a> to a parliamentary question on December 17, 2013, the then Minister of State for Home Affairs R.P.N. Singh stated that the Government does not plan to issue any executive order to give a legal framework to NATGRID. <br /></p>
<p>The threshold of procedural safeguards requires that there is an appropriate independent institutional mechanism, with in-built procedural safeguards aligned with standards of procedure established by law which are just, fair and reasonable to prevent abuse. In <a href=""http://loksabhaph.nic.in/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=29595&amp;lsno=16"">response</a> to a parliamentary question on March 1, 2016 the then Minister of State for Home Affairs Haribhai Parthibhai Chaudhary stated that “An Audit Committee headed by Deputy National Security Advisor has been constituted to audit the manner in which the data is accessed and sought to be used.” It is our view that such a measure is not sufficient to satisfactorily respond to the privacy concerns which may arise.<br /></p>

13536,"Kerala HC to hear Aarogya Setu petitions in September 2020 #SaveOurPrivacy",kerala-hc-to-hear-aarogya-setu-petitions-in-september-2020-saveourprivacy,,,admin,2020-08-26,,Yes,live,"Devdutta Mukhopadhyay","<h3>Tl;dr</h3>
<p>On Monday i.e. 24 August 2020, a Single Judge Bench of the Kerala High Court heard a writ petition filed regarding third party data sharing and mandatory imposition of the Aarogya Setu app launched by the Indian Government during the COVID-19 pandemic. This petition was filed by Mr. Jackson Mathew as a follow up to his previous petition filed in May 2020 after the Ministry of Home Affairs made use of Aarogya Setu mandatory for all public and private sector employees. Both petitions filed by Mr. Mathew are scheduled to be listed before a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court in September 2020.
</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>On 01 May 2020, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued guidelines under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 which made use of the Aarogya Setu app mandatory for all public and private sector employees. The head of an organization was also made responsible for ensuring 100% coverage of the Aarogya Setu app among all employees. Aggreived by this, Mr. Jackson Mathew, who employs over 50 people in his paper cup manufacturing business, filed a petition before the Kerala High Court (Read more <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/kerala-hc-hears-challenges-against-mandatory-imposition-of-aarogya-setu/"">here</a>). Soon after the petition was filed, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued revised guidelines on 17 May 2020 which encouraged use of the Aarogya Setu app on a ""best efforts"" basis but stopped short of making it mandatory (Read more <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/aarogya-setu-victory/"">here</a>).
</p>
<p>However, this was only a partial victory because a few days later on 21 May 2020, the Ministry of Civil Aviation issued an order which provided conflicting guidelines about whether Aarogya Setu was mandatory for passengers who wanted to undertake domestic air travel. The confusion resulting from the conflicting guidelines led to a situation where use of the Aarogya Setu app was mandatory for all practical purposes for flight passengers (Read more <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/aarogya-setu-air-travel-survey/"">here</a>).
</p>
<h3>Private Sector Access</h3>
<p>Since its launch as a proximity exposure notification app, the government has also added several new features to Aarogya Setu which raise concerns about function creep and third party data sharing. For a while, the app was used to refer users to select telemedicine and e-pharmacy services listed on the Aarogya Setu Mitr portal till this practice was <a href=""https://theprint.in/health/govt-suspends-aarogya-setu-portal-for-e-pharmacies-after-chemists-move-delhi-hc-against-it/442908/"">discontinued</a> after brick and mortar pharmacies filed a petition before the Delhi High Court. As media reports have <a href=""https://the-ken.com/story/the-elite-vc-founder-club-riding-aarogya-setu-to-telemed-domination/"">explained</a>, integration of services like telemedicine and e-pharmacies with the Aarogya Setu app creates a serious conflict of interest since many of these services are being provided by private entities whose executives were involved in the development of the app.
</p>
<p>The functional aspects of the Aarogya Setu app have also been changed to facilitate sharing of data with third parties. For instance, on July 05, 2020, the app was <a href=""https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/technology/aarogya-setu-adds-three-big-features-for-users-including-delete-account-option-all-you-need-to-know/2015886/"">updated</a> with the option of granting permission to external third-party apps to access the user’s health status. Most recently, on August 22, 2020, the government <a href=""https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/government-launches-open-api-service-in-aarogya-setu-app/article32419547.ece"">launched</a> an ‘Open API Service’ to enable employers to receive real-time information about the risk status of their employees, customers and users. While consent of the employee is required under the Open API Service, in reality, employees may not have enough bargaining power to resist imposition of the app by the management.
</p>
<h3>Follow up Litigation before Kerala HC</h3>
<p>The second petition which raises concerns about third party data sharing and the lack of clarity about whether Aarogya Setu is voluntary or mandatory was filed on 20 August 2020. To address residual concerns associated with the Aarogya Setu app, the petition seeks two main reliefs. First, it seeks a direction restraining the government from sharing any personal data collected by the Aarogya Setu app with third parties for access to convenience services or issuance of e-pass. Second, it seeks a direction to the government to give wide publicity to the voluntary nature of Aarogya Setu through electronic, print and social media and on the app itself.
</p>
<p>The petition was listed for hearing before the Kerala High Court on 24 August 2020 i.e. Monday. During the hearing, the Single Judge Bench of Justice Anu Sivaraman directed that this writ petition should be listed with other connected matters before a Division Bench. The matter is likely to be listed next after the Onam Holidays in September 2020. The petitioner was represented by Advocates Santhosh Mathew and Anil Sebastian Pulickel and we, at IFF, are grateful to have had the opportunity to assist the legal team in this case.

<p>Today, 135 individuals including a large number of lawyers and 7 organizations sent a representation to the Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court and various District &amp; Sessions Judges against Aarogya Setu being mandatory for accessing Delhi District Courts. The representation highlights that such a requirement is likely to create barriers to justice, compromise the privacy of lawyers and their clients, and it has no basis in law.
</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>After a prolonged period of disrupted functioning due to the COVID-19 pandemic, physical filings have recently resumed in courts in Delhi. Different district courts have issued guidelines for this purpose which seek to prevent the spread of the virus within the court premises through measures such as wearing of masks and avoiding crowding. However, the Protocol issued for the South and South East District also mandates use of the Aarogya Setu mobile app by any lawyers, clerks or litigants who wish to enter the court premises.
</p>
<p>The Aarogya Setu app has been the subject of significant controversy, and concerns have been raised about the privacy and security of sensitive personal data collected by the app about a user's health and location. These objections also prompted the Ministry of Home Affairs to backtrack on its decision to make Aarogya Setu mandatory (read more <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/aarogya-setu-victory/"">here</a>) and its most recent Unlock 3.0. Guidelines clarify that use of Aarogya Setu is only required on a best efforts basis.
</p>
<p>Today i.e. 30 July 2020, 135 individuals including a large number of lawyers and 7 organizations sent a representation to the Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court and various District &amp; Sessions Judges against Aarogya Setu being mandatory for accessing courts in Delhi. The representation highlights that such a requirement is likely to create barriers to justice, compromise the privacy of lawyers and their clients, and it has no basis in law. We are extremely grateful to Mansi Sood who brought this important issue to our notice, drafted the representation and steered this entire effort.
</p>
<h3>Concerns about Exclusion &amp; Privacy</h3>
<p>Even in urban centres like Delhi, only 30-50% of the residents own Bluetooth compatible smartphones. As a result, making the Aarogya Setu mobile app a pre-condition for entry into court complexes will exclude a significant number of advocates, clerks and litigants (especially those who visit legal aid centers). Many lawyers are struggling to make ends meet due to disrupted functioning of courts during the COVID-19 pandemic, and forcing them to purchase a smartphone will only increase their suffering.
</p>
<p>Mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu in judicial establishments could also undermine attorney-client confidentiality. Aarogya Setu collects sensitive personal data including the location of persons and the potential for misuse of such data compromises this basic principle that forms the bedrock of the legal profession. Further, as per the Terms of Use of the app, such data is shared with unspecified government entities and third parties. In the absence of an adequate data protection framework in place, mandating the use of this application within court complexes greatly undermines the privacy and data security of all persons within these premises.
</p>
<p>In light of these concerns, the representation recommends that the following measures to be undertaken:
</p>
<ul><li>Convene a meeting of all District Judges for a standardised SOP which recognises the challenges and concerns in the use of Aarogya Setu for court complexes.
</li><li>Recognise the concerns associated with Aarogya Setu and issue an advisory clarifying that use of the app should not be made mandatory for any physical filing or securing entry into any judicial or court complexes in Delhi, including all District Courts as well as the Delhi High Court.
</li><li>Ensure strict implementation of methods of risk mitigation outlined by the Ministry of Home Affairs, including but not limited to social distancing, face covering and regular sanitisation, within judicial/court complexes.

13538,"Survey about use of Aarogya Setu for air travel #SaveOurPrivacy",survey-about-use-of-aarogya-setu-for-air-travel-saveourprivacy,,,admin,2020-07-22,,Yes,live,"Anushka Jain","<h3>Tl;dr</h3>
<p>Since domestic air travel was resumed in May 2020, confusion has reigned about whether use of Aarogya Setu is mandatory for passengers. The government has claimed that use of Aarogya Setu is not mandatory and passengers can fill a self-certification form instead. However, in practice, passengers are being forced to download Aarogya Setu prior to entering the airport or boarding their flight due to lack of clarity in the guidelines issued by the government. That's why we are requesting people who have undertaken air travel since May 2020 to fill a survey so we can figure out the scale of the problem and take appropriate remedial measures.
</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>On 20 May 2020, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued an <a href=""https://www.mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/MHAOrderDt_20052020regdeletionofdomesticairtravelofpassengers.pdf"">order</a> removing ""domestic air travel"" from the list of activities prohibited during the COVID-19 related nationwide lockdown. Subsequent to this, the Ministry of Civil Aviation issued detailed <a href=""https://www.civilaviation.gov.in/sites/default/files/Order_of_MoCA_dated_21st_May_2020.pdf"">guidelines</a> for domestic air travel on 21 May 2020. These guidelines provide conflicting information about whether use of Aarogya Setu is mandatory to different stakeholders i.e. passengers, airports and airlines.
</p>
<p>The government has <a href=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/aarogya-setu-app-not-mandatory-for-air-rail-travel-centre-to-karnataka-hc/articleshow/76343053.cms?from=mdr"">stated</a> before the Karnataka High Court that use of Aarogya Setu is voluntary and passengers who do not want to download the app can fill a self-certification form instead. However, several passengers have reported that they were asked to show their Aarogya Setu status and they were not given the option of filling a self-certification form. An added complication is that some states also require passengers arriving from other states to download Aarogya Setu prior to leaving the airport at their destination of arrival.
</p>
<h3>Need for systematic data collection</h3>
<p>The prevailing confusion combined with the information and power asymmetry between passengers and officials has resulted in a situation where Aarogya Setu is voluntary on paper but can be made mandatory in practice. This has also been subject of extensive discussion among our community members on the <a href=""https://forum.internetfreedom.in/t/aarogya-setu-is-msndatory-or-not-mandatory/1053"">Internet Freedom Forum</a> and it made us realize that there exists a need to systematically collect data about this problem which goes beyond anecdotal evidence.
</p>
<p>That's why we are requesting people who have undertaken air travel since May 2020 to fill this survey so we can figure out the scale of the problem and take appropriate remedial measures. While filling the survey, we request you to fill all the fields of information and briefly describe your experience in your own words, though the latter is optional. The results of the survey will be used only after removing all personally identifiable details of the respondents.

<p>Two days ago, the Government of India banned 59 mobile apps. The reasons for this include national security and protection of user privacy and security. This sets a concerning precedent and may be a singular action of web censorship that has impacted more people India than ever before. In this post, we, through our statement, indicate areas of concerns around the legality of the process and also indicate how, by filing Right to Information requests, we are hoping for greater public disclosure.
</p>
<h3>A concerning act of web censorship</h3>
<p>On June 29, through <a href=""https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=1635206"">a press release</a> the Government of India acting through the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MEITY) banned 59 smartphone applications. To provide clarity from the perspective of digital rights of users we published an initial statement linked below.
</p>
<p>We are substantiating this initial statement with a detailed analysis which indicates several concerns on the legality of the blocking process. To achieve further clarity and transparency we have also yesterday morning filed several right to information requests.
</p>
<p>The detailed statement follows below:
</p>
<blockquote>As firm believers in the Constitution of India our mission is to ensure that technology should further the goals set out in the preamble. These goals cannot be achieved if the integrity and the security of India is compromised. To safeguard them our republic prescribes clear means and measures that are premised on a democratic framework. The hallmark of this are our fundamental rights.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In one of the most significant cases concerning the interaction of these fundamental rights with digital technologies, hearing a challenge against Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 the Supreme Court also had occasion to examine the power of the Government to issue directions to block web services. This power contained under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 contains the power to issue directions for blocking along with its grounds in it's first sub-section. The second-subsection to Section 69A contains a requirement to establish a process and safeguards under which the IT Blocking Rules, 2009 have been made.</blockquote>
<blockquote>This power has been purportedly been exercised by the Ministry of Electronics and IT on June 29, 2020 which has been publicly disclosed through a press release through the Press Information Bureau (PIB). This press release indicates distinct grounds under which 59 smartphone applications have been blocked that are contained under in an Annexure. The release contains references to threats to the security, integrity of India and public order of an ""emergent nature"" for which the direction to block these web services are ""emergency measures"". The further basis of this direction to block is premised on purported complaints including a recommendation from the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Committee, Ministry of Home Affairs and complaints received by CERT-In. Further references are made to debates and comments made in Parliament.</blockquote>
<blockquote>While acknowledging the real harm which occurs to the privacy and security of users due to the unregulated expropriation of their personal data we are also concerned with a restriction of their right to receive information and use such services. As per our reading of Section 69A it does not extend to directions for blocking smartphone applications but individual pieces of information and content. We are particularly concerned with the legal process which has been initiated for these directions given they do not contain any available technical analysis against any specific application prior to the media release on the direction for blocking. This sets a worrying precedent and tremendous expansion of the power to block web services in India.</blockquote>
<blockquote>There seems to be any pre-decisional hearing which has been afforded to any of these 59 web-services and given they have been accessible for a long period of time a regular process in which they were afforded a hearing would be naturally expected. Such ""emergent circumstances"" even when they did emerge do not specifically indicate any technical assessments conducted by CERT-In and do not also clearly indicate whether they are linked to recent border tensions caused due to China given there is a natural inference that many of these web services are of Chinese origin or control.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The press release is a drastic step and expansion in the practice of website blocking. It presents risk of setting a precedent that will undermine the digital rights of Indian internet users. Such directions are in deviation from the rule of law framework under the provisions of the Information Technology Act and the judgement of the Supreme Court as adverted above. In view of the above we call on the Government of India to publish the legal order (not a media release) and make proper disclosures. We further urge that specific regulatory instruments such as the Data Protection Bill to safeguard individual privacy must be advanced. Further if action is needed due to security reasons in examining foreign control made in core sectors such as technology and telecoms then appropriate policy conversations may be initiated. Here non-compliance can be penalised in an objective and evidence based manner with a clear legal standard that may include fines and directions to abstain from illegal conduct.</blockquote>
<blockquote>We caution against the expansion of the power to block web-services. This is bad for users, innovation, the larger technology ecosystem of India. We urge the Government to reconsider this dangerous step which sets a worrying precedent for digital rights.</blockquote>
<p>In view of this statement and to seek further transparency we have initiated steps commencing with the filing of Right to Information Requests with several government departments.
</p>
<p><strong>Right to Information requests filed by IFF</strong>
</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, we filed Right to Information requests with multiple authorities in the hopes of bringing transparency and accountability to the process through which this ban is being implemented. Requests have been filed with the Ministry of Electronic &amp; Information Technology (MeitY) through its Department of Electronics &amp; Information Technology (DeitY) and Department of Telecommunication (DoT). We have also filed a separate request with the DeitY for obtaining information from the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) which operates under the department. Lastly we have filed a request with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to obtain information about their involvement in the ban. Below we have provided insight into each of these requests.
</p>
<p>A. Right to Information requests with MeitY
</p>
<p>i. With DeitY and DoT on the ban
</p>
<p>In our requests dated June 30, 2020 with Ref. No.s DITEC/R/E/20/00519 (DeitY) and DOTEL/R/E/20/00577 (DoT), we asked these two authorities to provide us with copies of the actual order issued by MeitY banning these applications, since currently we only have a press release and not the actual order. Obtaining the order is crucial since it contains the reasons for the ban which are important when we try to assess the legality and validity of the ban. We also asked them whether the process which is stated under S.69A of the IT Act and the Blocking Rules, 2009 for blocking of websites was followed in the implementation of this ban. This process includes giving notice, having a hearing and providing a reasoned order for blocking.
</p>
<img src=""https://internetfreedom.in/content/images/2020/07/fullsizeoutput_723.jpeg"" class=""kg-image"" style=""width:480px;"" alt=""fullsizeoutput_723.jpeg"" />RTI Ref. No. DITEC/R/E/20/00519 filed with DeitY dated 30.6.2020<p>In the press release, it is stated that the blocking was being done because MeitY had ""received many complaints various sources including several reports about misuse of some mobile apps available on Android and iOS platforms for stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users’ data in an unauthorized manner to servers which have locations outside India."" In our request, we asked them to provide us copies of these complaints. Additionally, we asked them whether they had carried out any objective assessments on the privacy impact of these applications and to provide us with a copy of the reports of these assessments if they had been carried out.
</p>
<img src=""https://internetfreedom.in/content/images/2020/07/fullsizeoutput_724.jpeg"" class=""kg-image"" style=""width:480px;"" alt=""fullsizeoutput_724.jpeg"" />RTI Ref. No. DOTEL/R/E/20/00577 filed with DoT dated 30.6.2020<p>ii. With DeitY for obtaining information from CERT-IN
</p>
<p>In our request dated June 30, 2020 with Ref. No. DITEC/R/E/20/00521, we asked DeitY to provide us with information about the role played by CERT-IN in the implementation of the ban. According to the press release, CERT-IN ""has also received many representations from citizens regarding security of data and breach of privacy impacting upon public order issues"". Thus, we asked them to provide us with a copy of all the representations that they have received which flag such concerns about the blocked applications. Additionally, we asked them to provide us with the minutes of the any meetings that they held wherein this issue was discussed as a measure of increasing transparency and accountability. Finally, we asked them whether CERT-IN had carried out any objective assessments on the privacy impact of these applications and to provide us with a copy of the reports of these assessments if they had been carried out.

</p>
<p>In our request dated June 30, 2020 with Ref. No. MHOME/R/E/20/03251, we asked MHA to provide us with a copy of all the representations that they had received which were ""raising concerns from citizens regarding security of data and risk to privacy relating to operation of certain apps"" as stated in the press release. It was also stated in the press release that the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C), which operates under the MHA, had ""sent an exhaustive recommendation for blocking these malicious apps"". We asked them to provide us with a copy of this recommendation as it would help us in assessing the reasons behind the ban.
</p>
<p>We also asked them to provide us with the minutes of the any meetings that I4C held wherein this issue was discussed. Additionally, we asked them whether I4C had carried out any objective assessments on the privacy impact of these applications and to provide us with a copy of the reports of these assessments if they had been carried out. Finally, we asked them to provide us with a copy of all the correspondence which took place between the MHA and MeitY with regard to the ban.

<p>The Apex Committee of the MoRTH met on 4 June 2020 via a videoconference and decided to scrap its Bulk Data Policy (2019) that had earlier allowed private and government entities to buy bulk data from the ministry. This data was part of the MoRTH’s Vahan and Sarathi databases that contain sensitive details related to the citizens’ Vehicle Registration Certificates (RC) and Driving Licences (DL). While we acknowledge that this is a forward-thinking step aimed in the right direction, we also made a case that more loopholes need to be plugged, and more changes need to be incorporated to secure the citizens’ privacy and security in a more foolproof manner. So, we wrote to the Ministry highlighting critical steps as we move forward towards more complete privacy and security.
</p>
<h3>The Background</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Road, Transport and Highways (MoRTH) holds citizen records as part of their issuance of Vehicle Registration Certificates and Driving Licences under their Vahan and Sarathi databases, or together referred to as Parivahan. In March 2019, the ministry decided to monetise this data by selling it to research and commercial institutions as part of their <a href=""https://parivahan.gov.in/parivahan/sites/default/files/NOTIFICATION%26ADVISORY/8March%202019.pdf"">Bulk Data Sharing Policy</a> (2019). While this mostly held non-personal details like chassis number, model type, year of manufacture among others, the MoRTH itself admitted that this data could be subject to Triangulation. Triangulation refers to the combination of different data-sets, which individually do not reveal much but viewing them together could lead to individual identification, and dilution of privacy. However, the policy did not provide any measures against triangulation, and simply placed the burden on the business/entity buying the data.
</p>
<p>Making this worse is the fact that personal data like owner’s name and recent traffic violations can be accessed freely by anyone via the MoRTH’s Parivahan website, and mParivahan mobile app. Hence, it was not surprising that in February during the unrest in New Delhi, <a href=""https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/telangana/2020/feb/27/delhi-violence-miscreants-use-apps-to-find-rto-data-to-target-people-2109051.html"">reports</a> started coming in, which claimed that miscreants were using these easily accessible databases to target vehicles owned by the people of religious minorities.
</p>
<p>IFF had reacted immediately and <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VsCBmUqTP0fsN8frC-YWAcGGK889g--R/view"">written to the ministry</a> highlighting all the problems plaguing this practice of selling citizens’ data, and its lack of foresight in making personal information like name and traffic violation records freely available for malicious agents to exploit. We had summarised our stance and efforts in this <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/we-have-written-to-government-asking-them-to-stop-risks-of-misuse-of-government-datasets/"">blog post</a> dated 26 February, 2020. Soon after, a few <a href=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/transport-ministry-to-partially-conceal-names-of-vehicle-owners-on-vahan-database/articleshow/74338287.cms"">ministry officials had informed </a>the media that the MoRTH was working to partially conceal the names of the owners on these databases.
</p>
<h3>Bulk Data Sharing Policy SCRAPPED! But the victory is still incomplete!</h3>
<p>The Apex Committee of the MoRTH met on 4 June, 2020 to deliberate mainly on the privacy and security issues arising from the Bulk Data Sharing Policy. It was unanimously decided that selling of Vahan and Sarathi data to businesses can be prone to misuse. The basis of this reasoning resulted in scrapping the policy and we were pleased to know . We were also happy to note that the committee realises that such personal and sensitive data is not fit for sharing even through reports, and it is committed to complying with the Data Protection when it is legislated.<br /><br />However, there are few issues that arise as a consequence of the topics discussed, and the proposals made during the meeting. Here are the major loopholes that we have identified, which need to be plugged to ensure that this step towards honouring the privacy of the citizens is fully realised. Hence, we <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s5Nv5mI6QafE0TjSi-H3ge4KhfIeDdPf2fY2XezO6GY/edit"">called upon the MoRTH</a> to take note of these issues and made a case as to why each of them is critical:
</p>
<ul><li><strong>Preventing accumulation of personal data through government proxies:</strong> The Committee decided that <em>‘the non-personal anonymized vehicle data available in the National Register be provided free of cost as a bulk data on considering such requests from reputed public research institutions / educational institutions, which are controlled by the Central Government or the State Governments. Further, such institutions shall share the study / research findings to the Ministry and that the institutions shall not further share the data to other organizations’ </em>Here adequate measures should be taken to prevent private use through such bodies which may be used as proxies. It should be considered that a lot of research projects at both dedicated research institutions as well as educational institutions are funded by private funders and organisations. In this case, the sanctity of the data can not be ensured since the institute would invariably be sharing this bulk data with these private funders, directly or indirectly through reports. Therefore, we feel that simply giving data access to publicly funded institutions will not solve the problem as the data will still remain prone to misuse. We recommend proper transparency and accountability mechanisms even when data is shared with Central Government or State Government entities.
</li><li><strong>Definition and risks of sharing, ‘non personalised anonymised vehicle data’</strong>: We made a case that while removing personal identifiers like name and address does make the data anonymised, this can easily countered by a process called Triangulation as acknowledged itself in the Bulk Data Sharing Policy. Triangulation means the combination of different datasets which individually do not reveal much but viewing them together could lead to individual identification, and dilution of privacy. Given that personal details like owner’s name and traffic violation data are so readily available for public access on the Parivahan database, simply anonymising this data at one place will not solve any purpose until measures are put in place that prevent the possibility of triangulation. Here, we recommended instituting specific studies and risk assessments prior to the sharing of any such data with a focus on definition of what specifically constitutes, “non personal anonymised vehicle data”.
</li><li><strong>Follow up steps for ensuring deletion of data shared:</strong> The Committee remarked that, ‘it was further clarified that since the existence of the Bulk Data Sharing Policy at a cost, only a single request for the requirement of Bulk Data is being processed in the Ministry, but the application has not been accepted till date by the Ministry and is pending’. However, an answer to the Unstarred Question No. 1698 in the Rajya Sabha dated 8 July, 2019 reveals that the ministry sold bulk data stored in its Vahan and Sarathi databases to 32 government entities and 87 private entities since the inception of the policy in March 2019. Furthermore, this RTI reply [<a href=""https://archive.org/details/companieswithvahandata/mode/2up"">link</a>] suggests that as of 1 August, 2019, at least 142 entities bought vehicle and licence data from the ministry. Therefore, we urged the ministry to verify this and duly state what is the current situation as this discontinuity in information is giving rise to a lot of confusion. And, in case the data is still held by other entities, we recommended that the government needs to ensure that this data is duly deleted. Our recommendation is that these entities should be made to sign an undertaking on an affidavit claiming the deletion of the datasets countersigned by their statutory auditors. This will ensure that misuse and mishandling of the data is prevented.
</li><li><strong>Parivahan Website and Mobile Apps:</strong> While scraping the Bulk Data Sharing Policy is a a very positive step, any positive outcomes would be nullified as long as personal and sensitive data like vehicle owner’s name and traffic rule violations can be freely, and quickly accessed via the Parivahan websites and mobile apps. We strongly believe that the names and traffic violations data can be removed from these platforms without affecting the functionality of the app and the website. Making sensitive data like this so easily accessible has very dangerous implications for security and privacy. This was evidenced during the state-wide unrest in Delhi in the month of February when unverified reports came out on social media that malicious agents identified individuals from religious minorities and damaged their vehicles, using the data from the Parivahan database. We, therefore, urged the ministry to remove the names of the owners and traffic violation data from the Parivahan database.
</li></ul><p>Additionally, the Apex Committee decided that a special committee comprising JS (MVL, MoRTH), Director (MVL,MoRTH), Shri Joydeep Shome, DDG (NIC) and Smt. Yagnapriya Bharath, CGM (IRDAI) shall be constituted to finalise structure, standardisation and mechanism for sharing of reports in public domain, through the portal. Here, we urged the Honourable Minister to make this process deliberative and participatory. We believe that the decision on the process of sharing these reports should involve all possible stakeholders like citizens, civil society members, digital rights organisations, traffic, security and technology experts among others so that both the process and decision are inclusive and well-informed. Today, fellow Indians and civil society organisations are eager to assist the Government in participatory rule-making to ensure individual liberty, social justice and the imperatives of good governance.

<p>As per an update on the parliamentary website the Committee on IT is meeting on June 10, 2020 to discuss the issue of, ""Citizens data security and privacy"". We are particularly hopeful that this occurs after our request on May 8, 2020 to hold urgent hearings on <em>Aarogya Setu</em>. To keep the committee members up to date, and to serve as a briefing document, we yesterday sent across a range of materials which not only focus on <em>Aarogya Setu</em> but also the massive vulnerability reported on CSC Services that exposed millions of records including Aadhaar and caste records.
</p>
<h3>Urgent hearings on data security and privacy</h3>
<p>The Parliamentary Standing Committee is a vital body to inform the law making process on issues of digital rights. While it has been actively meeting on a range of issues the present pandemic has impacted it's work. The last meeting of the committee was on March 18, 2020 and, more disconcertingly the last time it had the occasion to discuss the issue of our data security and privacy was last year on December 13, 2019. Hence, it becomes incredibly important given the incredible pace of developments particularly the growth of government surveillance as well as increase in the collection sensitive personal data through applications such as <em>Aarogya Setu</em> a meeting is held soon.
</p>
<p>We have highlighted this in our a letter we first wrote on June 10, 2020 making our case. This has been explained <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/get-up-stand-up-for-our-privacy-rights/"">at length in this blogpost</a> and also acknowledged by the Chairperson of the Committee, Dr. Shashi Tharoor.
</p>
<img src=""https://internetfreedom.in/content/images/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-04-at-6.05.57-PM.png"" class=""kg-image"" style=""width:480px;"" alt=""Screenshot-2020-06-04-at-6.05.57-PM.png"" /><a href=""https://twitter.com/ShashiTharoor/status/1259472308881645568?s=20"">Link</a><p>Subsequent to this, a notice was published a few days back announcing the Committee would indeed be meeting on June 10, 2020 and would be holding a hearing with officials from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. The subject for this would be citizens data security and privacy. We believe this hearing can be conducted either in person or through remote conference keeping in mind the urgency of the issue as well as accounting for the safety and wellness of the members. Stopping the functioning of parliamentary committees would impact not only the quality of law making but severely undermine the functioning of our democracy.
</p>
<p>This concern matches a global trend. As per a comment by Chakshu Roy, head of legislative and civic engagement at PRS Legislative Research in an <a href=""https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-moving-house-online-6371526/"">Op-ed in the Indian Express</a> dated April 21, 2020, “[<em>t]he committees of parliaments of more than 15 countries are working online</em>”.
</p>
<h3>Keeping the Committee up to date!</h3>
<p>Clearly a lot has happened since June 10, 2020. To keep the committee up to date and to make the most of it's hearing with officials from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology we sent them a bunch of recent updates. These include the following:
</p>

<p>As per <a href=""https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/report-csc-bhim-leak/"">a report</a> published by the website, “vpnMentor” a website that provided for on-boarding services for BHIM (a UPI payment app like Google Pay) contained a security vulnerability. This reportedly impacted millions of Indians for more than two years and exposed several, incredibly sensitive pieces of information including Aadhaar Cards and Caste certificates. While this immediately met with blanket denials from Government officials, we are urging for recommendations that will help improve our digital public infrastructure by encouraging cyber security researchers in India.
</p>
<h3>A massive security vulnerability impacting millions of India</h3>
<p>Two days back vpnMentor <a href=""https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/report-csc-bhim-leak/"">reported</a> a massive cyber security vulnerability impacting sensitive financial and personal data impacting millions of Indians. Those impacted are from semi-urban and rural backgrounds leaving them particularly vulnerable and practically incapable to take effective steps to safeguard themselves.
</p>
<p>The vulnerability impacted the website <a href=""http://cscbhim.in/"">http://cscbhim.in/</a> which is operated by CSC e-Governance Services India Limited (CSC). CSC is a special purpose vehicle set up by the Ministry of Electronics &amp; IT (MEITY). The principal role of CSC has been to promote and on-board millions of Indians particularly farmers and semi-urban and rural businesses (Village Level Entrepreneurs or VLEs) towards Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) to ostensibly promote financial inclusion through electronic payments.
</p>
<p>The details of this vulnerability are truly shocking and reveal the following.
</p>
<ul><li><strong>Nature of the security lapse: </strong>The issue as explained is as follows, “<em>In this case, the data was stored on an unsecured Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket. S3 buckets are a popular form of cloud storage across the world but require developers to set up the security protocols on their accounts. The exposed S3 bucket was labeled “csc-bhim”, and our team was quickly able to identify the developers behind the website “www.cscbhim.in” as the owners of the data.</em>” A further lapse indicated was, “<em>The S3 bucket also contained an Android application package (APK), a file format used by Android’s operating system for the distribution and installation of apps. AWS Key pairs are the equivalent of admin user/password in Amazon’s infrastructure, potentially giving the holder of the key access to all data, the ability to start and stop servers, access the S3 bucket’s controls, and more.</em>”
</li><li><strong>Details of the personal data: </strong>The vulnerability impacted approximately 7.26 million records collected over the month of February 2019. Such records contained the details of scans of Aadhaar cards, scans of caste certificates, photos used as proof of residence, professional certificates and degrees, screenshots taken within financial and banking apps as proof of fund transfers along with Permanent Account Number (PAN) card details. To ensure authenticity, the researchers at vpnMentor have uploaded redacted screenshots of these records.
</li><li><strong>Impact of the security lapse:</strong> Such a vulnerability would have impacted millions of ordinary Indians who were on boarded onto these services. In practical terms this has left them susceptible to identity theft, fraud and viral attacks. It may even lead to cases of extortion and phishing for sensitive information. Further levels of vulnerability would be high considering the target populations of CSC belong to semi-urban and rural backgrounds. Shockingly, as the researchers state, the exposed records included those of minors. These risks are escalated due to a lack of proper training, relative lack of user knowledge and further absence of meaningful consent during the onboarding process. As the researchers put it, “<em>The exposure of BHIM user data is akin to a hacker gaining access to the entire data infrastructure of a bank, along with millions of its users’ account information.</em><strong>”</strong>
</li></ul><p><strong>Can we go beyond bald denials and towards securing public, digital systems?</strong>
</p>
<img src=""https://internetfreedom.in/content/images/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-03-at-3.45.57-AM.png"" class=""kg-image"" style=""width:480px;"" alt=""Screenshot-2020-06-03-at-3.45.57-AM.png"" />Credit : <a href=""https://braindedindia.wordpress.com/about/"">Braided Times</a><p>Some issues emerge from this cyber security incident on which we make specific recommendations:
</p>
<ul><li><strong>Admission and remedy by CSC: </strong>We were distressed by the official responses which rather than examining the nature of the claims in a meaningful manner, resorted to immediate denials. For instance as reported by MINT in it’s <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/technology/apps/records-of-bhim-users-allegedly-exposed-but-not-compromised-npci-denies-any-lapse-11591029987582.html"">report dated June 1, 2020</a>, Shri Dinesh Tyagi, CEO of CSC has stated that, “<em>The claim is incorrect because we never captured Aadhaar data in the entire process</em>,"". Further, the National Payment Corporation of India, stated by a <a href=""https://www.npci.org.in/sites/default/files/Media-statement-by-NPCI.pdf"">“Media Statement” dated June 1, 2020</a> on its website that, “<em>We would like to clarify that there has been no data compromise at BHIM App and request everyone to not fall prey to such speculations.</em>” While we do acknowledge that the security vulnerability does not impact BHIM by itself, it is plainly evident that the vulnerability impacted documents gathered through a referral partner (i.e. CSC) containing sensitive personal information. At the very least this requires a departmental inquiry.
</li><li><strong>Timelines and breach notification by CERT-In:</strong> As per the article CERT-In was first contacted on April 28, 2020 and date of action was May 22, 2020. This is almost a delay of close to two months in ensuring the proper configuration of a AWS S3 bucket of a seemingly standard configuration. We urge that the reason for it may be examined internally in order to hasten timelines for action and remedy as each moment of vulnerability can be exploited by malicious actors to the vulnerability of lakhs of ordinary Indians. Ideally, on the discovery and closure of the vulnerability a public statement should also follow by CERT-In in addition to a specific notification to each effected person on how it may impact them and what steps they should take to mitigate harm.
</li></ul><h3>Promote, not only protect our security researchers!</h3>
<p>In this context, the directions by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in its decision in Binoy Viswam v. Union of India [2017 <em>SCC</em> OnLine <em>SC</em> 647 at Para 126(iii)] serve as a reminder of the positive obligation to maintain data security when it stated that:
</p>
<blockquote><em>“It is also necessary to highlight that a large section of citizens feel concerned about possible data leak….It is important that the aforesaid apprehensions are assuaged by taking proper measures so that confidence is instilled among the public at large that there is no chance of unauthorised leakage of data whether it is done by tightening the operations of the contractors who are given the job of enrollment, they being private persons or by prescribing severe penalties to those who are found guilty of leaking the details….”</em></blockquote>
<p>Our broader recommendation is for a comprehensive and focussed push towards improving cyber security by encouraging Indian security researchers. We have anecdotally found that India's elite cybersecurity talent service foreign clients that conduct their work domestically, or towards improving digital, public systems.
</p>
<p>A large part of this has to also do with the absence of legal clarity and an absence of a centralised system for bug identification and bounties. Promoting such a system would create the right incentives for growing home-grown talent. Several granular recommendations by us on this subject are contained in our submissions on the <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/essential-features-of-a-rights-respecting-data-protection-law/"">Personal Data Protection Bill</a> as well as the <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/security-researchers-need-legislative-protection-from-vexatious-lawsuits/"">National Cyber Security Policy</a>.

</p>
<p>While most of the public’s attention remains targeted at the Central Government’s push to drive adoption of the Aarogya Setu app, we must remain vigilant when it comes to state level uses of health data during COVID-19 as well. The controversy surrounding the contract between the Government of Kerala and Sprinklr Inc. is being addressed by the Kerala High Court in the ongoing matter of <em>Balu Gopalakrishnan and Ors. v. State of Kerala and Ors.</em> The main questions raised pertaining to there being no safeguards against the commercial and unauthorized use of the health data of the citizens of Kerala by Sprinklr Inc. While an interim order dated April 24, 2020 provides some relief, it fails to address certain key issues. IFF has shared a representation with the Government of Kerala and an Expert Committee formed on the issue. In it, we have pointed out the lacunae in the order and have made specific suggestions on how best to resolve them. Our main recommendation is, in keeping with the ideal of competitive federalism, the Government of Kerala should develop a state level framework to regulate the collection, processing, storage, and security of health and related data during epidemic situations under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897.<br /></p>
<p><strong>What was the issue with Sprinklr Inc.?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Government of Kerala’s contract with Sprinklr Inc., a US based company, aims to create an online digital software/platform to process and analyse data of patients and those vulnerable/susceptible to COVID-19 in the State of Kerala. The arrangement aims to set up a Data Analytics Platform which integrates data from repositories across the Government, agencies and from the field so as to meet the exigency of a massive influx of data due to the pandemic.<br /></p>
<p>The <a href=""https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/what-is-the-sprinklr-row-kerala-govts-covid-19-response-6371205/"">controversy</a> arose when allegations were made that the government did not follow due procedures in appointing Sprinklr and thereby risked the transfer of crucial health data of thousands of people to pharmaceutical companies. While this is a valid concern, it also highlights the lack of governance discourse related to fundamental risks to people’s privacy which should have been a principal consideration while determining contours of the arrangement. The Contract between the two parties fails to address these risks. <br /></p>
<p>More specifically, the accompanying Non-Disclosure Agreement between the parties, states that the purpose of the contract is that, “the parties wish to explore a business opportunity of mutual interest and benefit”. This demonstrates a desire to keep available an opportunity to commercially exploit people’s sensitive personal information like their health data. Any such commercial use however can only be done after a system of legislative and independent institutional oversight is put in place. Such institutional oversight is lacking currently.<br /></p>
<p><strong>What did the Kerala High Court do?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Kerala High Court to its credit did highlight that maintaining data confidentiality is key when processing the health data of citizens of the State. The Court has issued an interim order dated providing some intervening relief to citizens even as it deliberates on the issue. These are:
</p>
<ul><li>It mandated that a process of anonymisation be followed before sharing this data with Sprinklr Inc.
</li><li>The Order directed that such data be shared with Sprinklr Inc. only after informing every citizen from whom the data is collected and obtaining specific consent from them.
</li><li>The Order injuncted Sprinklr Inc. from breaching the data confidentiality of the data obtained from the citizens of Kerala and ordered them to not disclose the data to any third party.
</li><li>The Order instructed Sprinklr Inc. to transfer back the data once the term of their contract with the Government of Kerala is completed.
</li><li>The Court injuncted Sprinklr from advertising or representing or holding over to any third party/person/entity – of whatever nature or composition – that they are in possession or have access to any data regarding COVID-19 patients or persons vulnerable/susceptible to it.<br /></li></ul><p>However, there were some issues that the High Court failed to address, the most important of which is the auditability of their Order. In our representation, we have highlighted the lacunae in the HC order and in the Contract between the Government of Kerala and Sprinklr Inc.<br /></p>
<p><strong>The Situation in the United Kingdom is similar and we can look to how Civil Society Organisations have addressed this there to create a solution</strong><br /></p>
<p>On May 18, 2020 civil society organisations, privacy advocates and academic researchers including Article 19, Liberty, openDemocracy and Privacy International wrote a <a href=""https://medium.com/@anoukruhaak/open-letter-b7cb79832064"">joint letter</a> to the UK Health Secretary’s office. In particular the letter addressed a March 2020 announcement by the UK’s National Health Service to grant private-sector tech firms access to the aggregated health data of millions of UK citizens towards building a datastore collected to specifically respond to the coronavirus.<br /></p>
<p>In it these disparate stakeholders urged the NHS to suitably clarify to the public, the following aspects, before commencing the development of the datastore:
</p>
<ol><li>What is the need for such a solution? What problems does such an arrangement aim to solve by building the datastore? What alternatives have been explored?
</li><li>How is the datastore financed? Has the NHS considered the trade-offs? What do these considerations look like?
</li><li>How does this proposal shift the balance of power from the public to the private sector?
</li><li>Who has control over the data in these public private partnerships ? Who is most at risk and how are they protected?
</li><li>What is the exit strategy? For what duration is the data collected and what happens when that period ends?
</li><li>If the exit strategy depends on the pandemic ending, then what criteria are used to determine when the pandemic is indeed over? (i.e. when is the promised destruction of the datastore triggered?)
</li><li>What public facing documentation do you intend to provide describing this datastore and the various data sources?
</li><li>Will further use of the datastore by the Department of Health Care Services, or its partners, outside the scope as currently defined, be communicated with the public?
</li><li>What party do you intend to use for privacy compliance and security auditing of the system<br /></li></ol><p>The situation in the UK is similar to the current situation in Kerala where Sprinklr Inc. has been entrusted with the health data of the citizens of Kerala. In particular, in the current instance data has been shared with a private party, not even located within Kerala, towards building an unknown software/analytics platform, which may even be leveraged for commercial use.<br /></p>
<p><strong>Constitutional Federalism is the need of the hour</strong>
</p>
<p>In an <a href=""https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/opinion/city-columns/how-the-lockdown-is-triggering-a-constitutional-crisis/articleshow/75513611.cms"">op-ed</a>, Mr.Raman Jit Singh Chima, who is also the Chair of the IFF Board of Trustees, has pointed out that the ideal of federalism which is enshrined in the Constitution of India is being undermined by Disaster Management Act, 2005 notifications being issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs. “Much of what the Ministry of Home Affairs is issuing in its orders under the Disaster Management Act impacts the powers of states and local bodies, as well as the fundamental rights of citizens.”<br /></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/towards-cooperative-federalism/article30729075.ece"">“Among the exclusively delineated areas of legislative and executive competence of States is the power and responsibility of public order and police.”</a> Additionally the competence to legislate on matters relating to public health including collection and processing of health data is contained in the State List under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. Keeping these factors in mind, we believe that the Government of Kerala should create a state level framework to regulate their collection, processing, storage, and security of health and related data during epidemic situations passed through Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. This may be done by issuing regulations on the same under the state government’s powers under the same act.<br /></p>
<p>We believe this presents the Government of Kerala with an opportunity to pass a framework which can allow for the responsible use of health data through ICT systems during epidemics/health crises. The framework may be applicable to both government actors and private parties as well. It would allow for adequate legal and institutional safeguards which suitably protect people’s privacy, whilst creating a legal pathway for data-side and tech based interventions as well.<br /></p>
<p><strong>Final recommendations by IFF</strong>
</p>
<p>Finally, aside from the urgent need for a regulatory framework as indicated above, we urged the Government of Kerala to suitably address our various concerns with its arrangement with Sprinklr Inc. as detailed throughout the representation. In particular we urge them to:
</p>
<ol><li>Application of the Kerala HC order should be verified by creating transparent systems of audit.
</li><li>The Kerala Government should prescribe a clear date of termination of the Contract with Sprinklr. They should also prescribe clear guidelines which can act as Standard Operating Procedure upon termination of Contract for complete extraction of data from Sprinklr.
</li><li>Adherence to best practices principles for collection and processing of health data which include currently existing frameworks such as the GDPR and the Supreme Court’s decision in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India.
</li><li>Finally, the Government of Kerala should use the questions asked in the open letter shared with the UK’s NHS vis-a-vis its datastore, as a template to deepen public engagement, understanding and dialogue on the project. Such engagement will help reduce privacy and security concerns and would also help people to share insights and suggest measures which may be taken for course correction on an immediate basis.<br /><br /></li></ol><p><strong>Important Documents</strong>

<p>Today, the Kerala High Court heard two petitions challenging mandatory use of the Aarogya Setu app. The app was made mandatory for all public and private sector employees by the Ministry of Home Affairs through guidelines issued to States/Union Territories under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. IFF provided legal assistance for the petition filed by Jackson Mathew, Managing Partner of Leetha Industries which was accompanied by an expert affidavit by Professor Subhashis Banerjee from IIT Delhi. During the hearings, the Kerala High Court directed the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to file a reply and to state on record that data collected by the app will not be misused. The petitions are listed next on 18 May.
</p>
<h3>Download Aarogya Setu or Face Jail Time</h3>
<p>On 1 May 2020, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued guidelines making use of the Aarogya Setu app mandatory for all persons in containment zones and all public and private sector employees. In case of the latter, the head of the organization has been made responsible for ensuring 100% coverage of the app among employees. These directions were issued by MHA under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 (DMA) and any violation is liable to be punished under Section 51, DMA (up to 2 years imprisionment) and Section 188, IPC (up to 6 months imprisonment).
</p>
<p>Since its launch, the Aarogya Setu app has been mired in controversy about its privacy and security practices, and we have analysed it in our <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/is-aarogya-setu-privacy-first-nope-but-it-could-be-if-the-government-wanted/"">working paper</a> which provides privacy prescriptions for COVID-19 tech interventions. After the Aarogya Setu app was made mandatory for vast sections of society by MHA on 1 May 2020, John Daniel, the General Secretary of Congress Thissur District Committee filed a PIL before the Kerala High Court challenging the constitutionality of these directions. Yesterday, another writ petition was filed by Jackson Mathew, the Managing Partner of Leetha Industries which employs 50 people against Aarogya Setu being made compulsory through the threat of criminal sanction. The petition filed by Jackson Mathew is accompanied by an expert affidavit by Dr. Subhashis Banerjee, Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Delhi which highlights utility and privacy concerns with the Aarogya Setu app. IFF retained counsels provided assistance for this petition.

<p>After the petition was filed by Jackson Mathew yesterday morning, the government has released a <a href=""https://meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Aarogya_Setu_data_access_knowledge_Protocol.pdf"">data access and knowledge sharing protocol</a> for the app. We will shortly be posting an analysis of the protocol and its failure to address concerns about legality, purpose limitation, data minimization, transparency and accountability.
</p>
<h3>Contagion of Technosolutionism</h3>
<p>Despite serious concerns about the accuracy of COVID-19 surveillance apps, governments across the world have tried to leverage these apps to contain the spread of the virus. As Susan Landau <a href=""https://www.lawfareblog.com/location-surveillance-counter-covid-19-efficacy-what-matters"">notes</a>, when you have a hammer, it is tempting to see nails everywhere but India doesn't even have the level of smartphone and internet penetration required for such apps to even be theoretically effective. In a country where only 25% of the population has access to bluetooth enabled smartphones, the government has made the Aarogya Setu app mandatory for accessing essential services like <a href=""https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/aarogya-setu-app-mandatory-for-travel-on-15-special-trains-railways/article31563211.ece"">railways</a> and this will have a devastating exclusionary impact.
</p>
<p>In addition to this, bluetooth and GPS signals are not an accurate estimate of whether someone has been in close proximity (6 feet or less) with a COVID-19 infected person. This can lead to a high number of false positives and false negatives which end up causing more harm than good. For instance, bluetooth signals cannot recognize physical barriers such as walls and floors which make virus transmission impossible, and therefore, they may misidentify individuals as COVID-19 positive and send the authorities on a wild goose chase. Similarly, since bluetooth based apps cannot account for surface to person transmission, they will also yield false negatives.
</p>
<h3>""Privacy by Design"" Not</h3>
<p>Despite the government repeatedly claiming that the Aarogya Setu app does not raise any privacy or security concerns, the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy of the app tell a very different story. The writ petition filed by Jackson Mathew analyses these issues in great detail but in brief, the Aarogya Setu app violates the following data protection principles:
</p>
<ol><li><strong>Legality</strong><br />The Aarogya Setu app which collects sensitive health and location data of millions of Indians has been launched without any governing legislative framework. The Disaster Management Act does not provide legislative basis for deployment of the Aarogya Setu app because it does not include any provisions for collection and processing of personal data. Retired Justice BN Srikrishna who headed the Committee on Data Protection has also <a href=""https://indianexpress.com/article/india/aarogya-setu-app-mandate-illegal-justice-b-n-srikrishna-6405535/"">explained</a> that making Aarogya Setu mandatory without an enabling legislation is completely illegal. He also pointed out that the protocol issued by the government cannot substitute legislation by the parliament.
</li><li><strong>Consent</strong><br />Based on <a href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/07/1000961/launching-mittr-covid-tracing-tracker/"">MIT Tech Review’s Tracker</a>, India is the only democratic country which has made use of COVID-19 surveillance apps mandatory. Other countries which have made such apps mandatory are China and Turkey. However, in Turkey, only confirmed COVID-19 patients have to mandatorily download the app.
</li><li><strong>Purpose Limitation and Data Sharing:</strong><br />Clause 2(a) of the Privacy Policy states personal data collected at the time of registration can be used for <em>“medical <u>and administrative interventions necessary”</u></em> in relation to COVID-19. This suggets that data collected by the app can be used for lockdown/quarantine enforcement. This is inconsistent with global best practices. For instance, the European Commission has clearly stated that data collected by COVID-19 surveillance apps should not be used for law enforcement or commercial purposes.
</li><li><strong>Data Minimization</strong><br />Aarogya Setu collects location data through GPS and it can be used to track real time movements of individuals. This violates the principle of data minimization because location data is not necessary to determine if a user was in proximity of a COVID-19 positive person and bluetooth signals are sufficient for this purpose.
</li><li><strong>Security</strong><br />The Aarogya Setu app anonymizes data by assigning each user a static device identifier. This kind of weak anonymization has been highlighted as a significant privacy concern by Professor Subhashis Banerjee in his expert affidavit. He notes that unlike other apps which issue new tokens to be used as a fresh ID after pre-specified time intervals, Aarogya Setu uses a static device identifier. This combined with the fact that Aarogya Setu collects several other data points including meta data, makes the app vulnerable to an attack where users can identify other users who have been determined by the app -rightly or wrongly - as high risk spreaders.
</li><li><strong>Transparency</strong><br />Clause 3 of the Terms of Service prohibits reverse engineering of the app which means that security researchers cannot independently study it to perform good faith vulnerability disclosure. The government has also refused to provide any technical specifications of the Aarogya Setu app. In contrast, other countries like Singapore, Israel and Australia have published the source code of their apps and other technical specifications relating to cryptography and bluetooth.
</li><li><strong>Accountability</strong><br />Clause 6 of the Terms of Service exempt the government from any liability for a person’s inability to access the app, inaccurate information about COVID-19 status of persons in one’s proximity and any breach of user data. Clause 7 of the Terms of Service further states that the government makes no warranties about the app’s accuracy and that such services are never wholly free from defects, errors and bugs.
</li></ol><h3>What happened at today's hearing?</h3>
<p>The PIL filed by John Daniel was listed before a Division Bench of Justice Anu Sivaraman and Justice MR Anitha as Item No. 8 and it came up for hearing around 11:30 AM. During the hearing, the counsel for the Petitioner sought interim relief to ensure that no coercive action was taken against anyone for failing to download the app. The counsel for MeitY insisted that Aarogya Setu was the best app in the world and emphasized that a protocol had also been issued to address privacy concerns. The bench was disinclined to intervene at this stage because ""extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures"". However, the bench directed the government to file a statement on record that the data collected by the app will not be misused and listed the matter on 18 May.
</p>
<p>The Writ Petition filed by Jackson Mathew was listed before a Single Judge Bench of Justice Gopinathan as Item 71 and it came up for hearing around 5:15 PM. During the hearing, Justice Gopinathan enquired about the previous proceeding before the Division Bench. Advocate Santhosh Mathew appearing for the Petitioner explained that this petition was not a PIL and highlighted the practical difficulties faced by the petitioner who would have to purchase smartphones for his employees and check whether they were using the Aarogya Setu app or risk criminal prosecution. The counsel appearing for MeitY once again insisted that the Aarogya Setu app is supposed to help the government fight COVID-19 and unless a large part of the population downloads it, the app will not be effective. In response, Advocate Santhosh Mathew emphasized on the aspect of criminal penalities and noted that even the Registrar or Chief Justice could be liable for imprisionment if any of the High Court employees failed to download Aarogya Setu. Justice Gopinathan acknowledged that this was a valid concern and he directed the counsel for MeitY to get instructions and file a statement on these aspects. This petition will be listed next on 18 May along with the petition filed by John Daniel before the Division Bench.
</p>
<p>Advocate Santhosh Mathew and his team comprising of Advocates Anil Sebastian Pulickel, Vijay Paul and Jaisy Elza Joe led this important court intervention. Lawyers, Gautam Bhatia and Abhinav Sekhri, IFF retained counsels, Vrinda Bhandari, Devdutta Mukhopadhyay and Sidharth Deb also provided drafting and research assistance for this petition.

<p>A diverse group of organizations and individuals have endorsed a representation to the Prime Minister's Office and various central government ministries on May Day opposing mandatory use of Aarogya Setu. This is specifically focussed for workers during the COVID-19 outbreak. The Aarogya Setu app which was initially touted as a <a href=""https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/aarogya-setu-app-world-bank-praises-india-contact-tracking-app-6360467/"">voluntary measure</a> has been made effectively been made mandatory for gig workers and government employees. This is despite failing to adhere to data protection standards and lacking algorithmic accountability. Today, an important joint representation signed by 37 organisations including labour unions, and 75 prominent individuals have endorsed a joint representation urging the government to issue an advisory clarifying that use of Aarogya Setu cannot be made mandatory and also recommends financial relief, protective equipment and healthcare coverage for gig workers during the COVID-19 related lockdown.
</p>
<h3>Schrödinger's App: Voluntary but also Mandatory!</h3>
<p>On 02 April 2020, the government launched a contact tracing app (which now is building even an <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/aarogya-setu-app-to-get-r-pass-feature-soon/story-qSXbwZmy931Dq9N02dOSVO.html"">e-pass functionality</a>) called Aarogya Setu which has been heavily criticized for failing to adhere to data protection principles of lawfulness, consent, purpose limitation, data minimization, transparency and accountability. IFF has previously published a working paper which explains the problems with Aarogya Setu in great detail and you can read about it <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/is-aarogya-setu-privacy-first-nope-but-it-could-be-if-the-government-wanted/"">here</a>. This working paper is being updated to account for subsequent changes but its fundamental concerns and recommendations about the problematic nature of Aarogya Setu remain valid. 
</p>
<p>While there were initial assurances that use of Aarogya Setu is <a href=""https://www.thequint.com/coronavirus/faq/faq-pm-modi-asked-to-download-aarogya-setu-coronavirus-app-but-is-it-mandatory"">voluntary</a>, it was soon made compulsory for employees of Prasar Bharati and Central Armed Police Forces. However, even the army seems to have data security concerns about Aarogya Setu and it has instructed its officers to not use the app at work. Since this representation was drafted and circulated, the government has made Aarogya Setu mandatory for all <a href=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/government-makes-aarogya-setu-app-a-must-for-its-employees/articleshow/75462689.cms"">central government employees</a> and reports suggest that it may soon be <a href=""https://www.livemint.com/technology/apps/govt-s-aarogya-setu-app-to-be-installed-on-smartphones-by-default-soon-11588170539557.html"">pre-installed</a> on all new smartphones.
</p>
<p>In addition to government employees, certain private companies in the gig economy have also made Aarogya Setu mandatory for their workers. As lockdown restrictions are eased and business operations resume, other employers in the gig economy as well as the traditional economy may make use of the app compulsory for workers. <a href=""https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/draft-e-com-sop-coo-responsible-for-meeting-norms-staff-to-download-aarogya-setu-app/articleshow/75231063.cms"">Reports</a> suggest that mandating use of Aarogya Setu may be a pre-emptive liability reduction measure by companies through draft guidelines for e-commerce which were privately circulated by the government mandate use of the app by all workers and hold the COO responsible for any violation.
</p>
<h3>Impact on Gig Workers</h3>
<p>The Terms of Service of the Aarogya Setu app exempt the government from any liability for losses arising from misidentification of an individual's COVID-19 status. This means that there is no remedy available if the app misidentifies a person as at risk of having COVID-19. This kind of misidentification can have serious consequences and it could force workers to self-isolate and lose their income and freedom of movement based on an opaque algorithm. Further, in the long term, Aarogya Setu could become a tool of mass surveillance and sensitive health and location data of workers could be used by law enforcement agencies for punitive purposes.
</p>
<p>In addition to this, timely, important research done by <a href=""https://tandemresearch.org/blog/covid19-and-relief-measures-for-gig-workers-in-india"">Tandem Research and CIS</a>, thas demonstrated the need for government to provide financial relief, protective equipment and healthcare coverage to gig workers who are struggling to make ends meet during the lockdown and face higher risk of contracting COVID-19 due to exposure to multiple customers everyday. In light of these concerns, we have sought to support the rights of gig workers, a number which grows each day with greater adoption of smartphones across the country.
</p>
<h3>Joint Representation to the Government </h3>
<p>Today, with the endorsement of 37 organisations and 75 individuals (till now), a joint representation will be sent at 7:00 PM to the Prime Minister's Office and the Ministries of Electronics &amp; IT, Labour, Home Affairs and Transport. The <strong>representation</strong> urges the issuance of an advisory to clarify that Aarogya Setu cannot be made mandatory for workers in the gig economy as well as the traditional economy. To quote from it:
</p>
<blockquote>""Considering the damaging impact of the Aarogya Setu app and COVID-19 lockdown on the privacy, autonomy and dignity of workers, we urge your office to undertake the below mentioned measures in collaboration with the private sector.</blockquote>
<blockquote>(a) Take cognizance of privacy concerns associated with Aarogya Setu and issue an advisory clarifying that use of the app should not be made mandatory for workers in the gig economy and also the traditional economy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>(b) In addition to (a), to ensure greater safety, rely on certain methods of risk mitigation such as working with companies to provide daily temperature checks and personal protective equipment to all gig and platform workers who continue working during the COVID-19 pandemic.</blockquote>
<blockquote>(c) Further, devise the right incentive structures both for companies and workers to ensure that gig and platform workers are able to sustain themselves during the lockdown and those displaying symptoms of COVID-19 are not forced to work to ensure their livelihood. This includes provisions for medical insurance and financial relief to all gig and platform workers who have been unable to work during the lockdown or have witnessed a significant decrease in earnings due to low demand.""</blockquote>

</p>
<p>We intend to follow this up with broader public advocacy efforts and are open to offers of collaboration – for instance making pamphlets or a '<em>jan parcha</em>' on Aarogya Setu for workers in local vernacular. If you would like to volunteer, please do join the <a href=""https://forum.internetfreedom.in/"">Internet Freedom Forum</a> where such projects can be pitched and discussed with our staff and community organically.

<h3>Tl;dr</h3>
<p>IFF has sent a <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GbWcIYqP7fI6kzatt44TiQOJiuHbqrqx/view?usp=sharing"">legal notice</a> to a government entity BECIL that intends to procure two items (amongst a larger procurement of various other medical safety devices), i.e. <em>“Personnel Tracking GPS Solution” </em>and the <em>“Covid–19 Patient Tracking Tool”. </em>We have called on BECIL to modify it's tender to account for the grave breaches to the privacy, dignity and autonomy of health care professionals and members of the public that will be caused by these technologies being used and implemented by the Government.
</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>We strongly support medical professionals who are the first responders to Covid-19. Protecting public health is a priority for all of us over at IFF. However, this cannot and should not be approached by breaches to privacy, dignity and autonomy of individuals, especially — medical professionals — in the absence of any clear basis in law.
</p>
<p>This is why we have sent a legal notice to the Broadcasts Engineering Consultants India Limited (BECIL is a PSU under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting). Our notice dated April 26, 2020 is limited to items in the tendering process specifically the <em>“Personnel Tracking GPS Solution” </em>and the <em>“Covid–19 Patient Tracking Tool”.</em> The procurement commenced for these technology tools while ostensibly intended to address health risks of Covid-19 cause certain injury to the constitutional rights of privacy, dignity and security rights of health care workers and those at risk of being infected by this virus.
</p>
<h3>""<em>Personnel Tracking GPS Solution</em>"" : Smartwatches or Digital Handcuffs?</h3>
<p>The first item sought to be procured is the “<em>Personnel Tracking GPS Solution</em>” for the ostensible health and safety of medical professionals and, “<em>rescue teams</em>”. The data collected through the, “<em>cloud based software application</em>” will be stored in a “<em>data centre… in India</em>”.
</p>
<img src=""https://internetfreedom.in/content/images/2020/04/Infographics---BECIL.png"" class=""kg-image"" style=""width:480px;"" alt=""Infographics---BECIL.png"" /><p>Specifically, there are three illegal features of this system as per the, “<em>Solution Objective</em>”, that will be implemented through a “<em>wrist watch/I-card/App</em>”.
</p>
<ul><li><strong>Deployment through physical wearable devices: </strong>There are repeated references to the use of this system through a, “<em>wrist watch/I-card/App</em>” which presumes that the deployment may be implemented through a personal wearable that is made compulsory.
</li><li><strong>Restrictive, invasive monitoring of healthcare workers through features such as geo-fencing and live movement tracking: </strong>The product functionality of this personnel tracking system is extensive with the ability for administrators to create, “<em>geofencing of zones</em>” and “<em>track workers of their location during working hours</em>”.
</li><li><strong>Use of facial recognition technologies intended to prevent, “impersonation control”:</strong> The “<em>wrist watch/I-card/App</em>” should have the ability to “<em>manually take photograph of the person who is wearing the wrist watch/ I-Card/ App</em>”, and “<em>store all employees reference pictures which will be used regularly by a designated set of supervisory staff to compare with the photos shot by the workers during working hours</em>”. Further functionality is indicated for, “<em>AI Based face detection of Employee</em>”.
</li></ul><p><em><strong>“Covid–19 Patient Tracking Tool” : A digital leash on every Indian?</strong></em>
</p>
<p>As per the Addendum No. 1 dated April 17, 2020 an additional item has been added for procurement under the title of a “Covid–19 Patient Tracking Tool”.
</p>
<img src=""https://internetfreedom.in/content/images/2020/04/Infographics---BECIL-1-.png"" class=""kg-image"" style=""width:480px;"" alt=""Infographics---BECIL-1-.png"" /><p>This tool, is incredibly invasive as per the following functionality listed below:
</p>
<ul><li><strong>Leaps from healthcare surveillance to national security: </strong>The intended objective of the tool as listed in Item No. 1 of the specifications is to conduct, “<em>Intelligence investigation platform &amp; tactical tool to detect, prevent and investigate threats to national security”.</em>

</li></ul><h3>Our legal notice and intention to take further action.</h3>
<p>Today, i.e. April 26, 2020 we sent a <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GbWcIYqP7fI6kzatt44TiQOJiuHbqrqx/view?usp=sharing"">legal notice to BECIL</a> clearly stating that the project offends the fundamental right to privacy, dignity and autonomy. We specifically reasoned how this project lacks any legality. In addition to this notice we intend to follow up this matter rigorously by seeking transparency in each step of this procurement and also if such situation does arise to examine steps to challenge it before an appropriate body.
</p>
<p>We hope this situation does not arise and BECIL acting within the powers reserved under the tendering process modifies and removes the procurement of both the <em>“Personnel Tracking GPS Solution” </em>and the <em>“Covid–19 Patient Tracking Tool”. </em>This also makes just common sense given the availability of funds should be focused towards the immediate needs of healthcare professionals such as PPC (Personal Protection Coverall) Kits which are also a part of the present procurement.
</p>
<p>Incidentally, this is our second legal notice to BECIL with the<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/notice-on-the-social-media-communication-hub-saveourprivacy/""> first being on the now recalled Social Media Communication Hub</a>. Subsequent to our notice the Ld. Mahua Moitra, Member of Parliment, Lok Sabha had filed a<a href=""https://twitter.com/internetfreedom/status/1025265141087129601""> public interest litigation in the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India leading to it's recall</a>. We urge BECIL to be mindful of this undertaking to even in the present procurement as it involves common concerns of mass surveillance and impact on the privacy of medical professionals – as well as every Indian.

</p>
<p>The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) has sought to revise its Request for Proposals (RFP) for tender bids for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS) according to an update on its website dated March 23, 2020. IFF has previously called for a three year moratorium on the government use of facial recognition technologies under its ongoing #ProjectPanoptic. In this instance, we have shared a representation with the NCRB and the Hon’ble Minister of Home Affairs Mr Amit Shah. In it, we highlight legal and constitutional issues with such projects. As a remedy our representation seeks a recall of this RFP and a halt to the tender process itself. It also provides concrete policy recommendations for the Government to consider.<br /></p>
<p><strong>Background on AFRS</strong>
</p>
<p>The RFP invites bids for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS), which has an estimated budget of INR 308 crore, to further create a national database of photographs. According to the RFP, this database is purported to be used to swiftly identify criminals by gathering existing data from various other databases like:<br /></p>
<ol><li>Passport database under the Ministry of External Affairs,
</li><li>Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) by the National Crime Records Bureau(NCRB) under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA),
</li><li>Interoperable Criminal Justice System (ICJS) by the NCRB under the MHA ,
</li><li>Women and Child Development Ministry's KhoyaPaya Portal,
</li><li>Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) by the NCRB under the MHA
</li><li>Any other image database available with police/other entities.<br /></li></ol><p>The NCRB first released the RFP calling for bids for the creation of AFRS on 28 June, 2019 (Document Reference: 02/001). Initially, the deadline for submission of bids was on August 16, 2019 (Read our first post on the subject <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/maskon/"">here</a>). However, the deadline for submission has been extended six times due to administrative reasons by the NCRB. According to an <a href=""https://ncrb.gov.in/sites/default/files/tender/AFRS.pdf"">update</a> dated March 23, 2020 published on the NCRB’s website, the RFP is now being revised. The current deadline for submission is May 22, 2020.<br /></p>
<p>As pointed out in our previous <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/problems-with-facial-recognition-systems-operating-in-a-legal-vacuum/"">blogpost</a> on the matter, use of this technology without having legal safeguards in place could lead to harms such as discrimination and exclusion which will be difficult to undo. Additionally, in the absence of a strong data protection law, use of this technology could easily lead to mass surveillance. A strong data protection law is needed to hold AFRS accountable in terms of collection, storage and usage of data including sharing of data across government agencies and with third parties to ensure that there is proportionality in processing the data collected. Proportionality during processing of personal data means that only that personal data which is adequate and relevant for the purposes of the processing is collected and processed.<br /></p>
<p><strong>Steps taken by IFF</strong><br /></p>
<p>IFF has sought a <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/we-have-written-to-the-government-seeking-a-3-year-moratorium-on-government-use-of-facial-recognition-technology-in-india-projectpanoptic/"">three year moratorium</a> to be imposed upon all government use of facial recognition technology. IFF has also consistently opposed the use of facial recognition by NCRB since the first report on AFRS came to light. IFF has previously sent a <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/the-ncrb-responds/"">legal notice</a> to NCRB seeking that they recall the RFP and halt the tender process since the project lacks a legal basis. IFF would like to thank the NCRB for responding to our previous legal notice and also for their decision to revise the RFP. However, we are of the opinion these steps being taken by the NCRB are insufficient and there is a need for further changes and immediate action.
</p>
<p>In this representation, therefore IFF recommends that:<br /></p>
<ol><li>NCRB immediately rollbacks its request for proposals and halts its ongoing tender process for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System.
</li><li>The Government of India place a moratorium of three years on the use of facial recognition technology by government authorities in India during which time an informed consultation takes place between the various stakeholders and civil society organizations to understand the ambit of this technology.
</li><li>The Government of India immediately passes a strong data protection law to hold government functionaries accountable when they collect people’s personal data whilst deploying such systems.
</li><li>The Government of India should pass a specific law with regard to facial recognition technology to regulate the technology in the country. This law should be developed as a result of the informed consultation process as mentioned above.<br /></li></ol><p><strong>What’s Next?</strong>
</p>
<p>IFF has been mapping the use of facial recognition all over the country as a part of its ongoing #ProjectPanoptic. In addition to seeking a three year moratorium on the use of this technology, we have been constantly seeking information about these projects all over India and have also been engaging with government authorities whenever the need arises. IFF will be developing and publishing more material as part of our ongoing analysis of this topic under this project in the coming months.<br /></p>

13549,"Data Protection and the National Population Register #SaveOurPrivacy",data-protection-and-the-national-population-register-saveourprivacy,,,admin,2020-02-28,,Yes,live,"IFF Policy Team","<h3>Tl;dr</h3>
<p>As part of its submission to the Joint Parliamentary Committee evaluating the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019, IFF has sent a brief analysing the impact of the Bill on the National Population Register. The brief highlights how the National Population Register violates data protection principles of lawfulness, consent, purpose limitation, data minimization and accountability. Based on this case study, the brief identifies various loopholes in the Bill and recommends necessary changes.
</p>
<h3>The Database Republic</h3><p>The National Population Register has been in the headlines during the ongoing protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act but the project has a long and interesting history. Originally proposed in 2001 in the aftermath of the Kargil War to address concerns of cross-border infiltration, the project was accelerated after the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks. Household surveys were conducted in 2010 for NPR, and demographic data, biometric data and other government identifiers were collected from the population. It is important to note biometrics and government identifiers are sensitive personal data and their misuse can cause significant harm to an individual.
</p>
<p>While there was an initial tussle between UIDAI and the Registrar General over whose database will have primacy, this was resolved by the Cabinet Committee on UID in 2010 with the Government deciding that the Registrar General will issue Aadhaar cards instead of Multi-Purpose National Identity Cards. In 2015, NPR was updated and seeded with Aadhaar numbers. The Election Commission also wanted Voter ID details to be mandatorily included in NPR so it could link Voter IDs with Aadhaar through this mechanism. Earlier in 2011, NPR data was used as the basis for the Socio-Economic Caste Census because the Census Act, 1948 prohibited census data from being used. Therefore, NPR became the channel to achieve what could not be done through databases which had higher levels of data protection.
</p>
<h3>Recommendations</h3>
<p>We analysed the NPR project against data protection principles recognized by the Supreme Court in the landmark judgement of <em>K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India</em> and found that it fell short on several aspects.<br /></p>
<img src=""https://internetfreedom.in/content/images/2020/02/NPR-Problems.png"" class=""kg-image"" style=""width:480px;"" alt=""NPR-Problems.png"" /><p>Based on this case study, we recommend the following changes should be made to the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 to fix loopholes which could lead to a disproportionate encroachment on individual privacy.
</p>
<ul><li>Clause 5 of the PDP Bill should state that only those purposes which are clearly mentioned in the primary legislation enacted by Parliament will qualify as a valid purpose for collection and processing of personal data if the government is building a database.
</li><li>Clause 35 of the PDP Bill should include principles of necessity and proportionality and mandate independent judicial oversight prior to any exemption being granted by the Central Government. This would also be consonant with the proportionality standard endorsed by the Supreme Court in <em>K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2017 10 SCC 1).</em> In any case, exemption from application of the entire PDP Bill should not be permitted and certain minimal requirements like preservation of quality and integrity of data and adherence to security standards should be required even under Clause 35.
</li><li>Clause 38 of the PDP Bill should be restructured and sub-clauses (d) and (e) should be incorporated as provisos which will serve as a pre-condition for grant of exemption for statistical purposes.

<p>IFF has prepared a public brief highlighting the impact of the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 on workplace surveillance. Technologies like CCTV cameras, location tracking and device monitoring have made it possible for employers to turn workplaces into a panopticon, and such pervasive surveillance undermines the dignity of labour and the ability of workers to unionise. We encourage you to read the brief and participate in the consultation being held by the Joint Parliamentary Committee to ensure existing power imbalances between workers and employers are not exacerbated by the Bill.
</p>
<h3>Your boss shouldn't be Big Boss</h3>
<p>Much has been written about the exemptions provided under the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 for governmental surveillance but there is another form of surveillance which the Bill permits that we should all be worried about. Clause 13 of the Bill exempts employers from seeking consent prior to processing personal data of their employees for recruitment and termination of employment, provision of services and benefits, verification of attendance and performance assessment. With advancement in technology, employers now have the ability to continuously monitor the real time activity of their employees through CCTV cameras, location tracking, device monitoring etc. By allowing employers to track bathroom breaks, lunch breaks and meetings of employees, such technologies pose a threat to the dignity of labour and the ability of workers to unionise.
</p>
<h3>Recommendations</h3>
<p>In order to ensure that any workplace surveillance is strictly need based, context specific and minimize intrusion into the personal lives of employees, we recommend that the following changes are made to the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019.
</p>
<ol><li>The principles of necessity and proportionality should be included under Clause 13, PDP Bill 2019.
</li><li>A mandatory obligation should be imposed on the employer to consult employees and seek their views prior to processing personal data under Clause 13, PDP Bill 2019.
</li><li>The Data Protection Authority should be entrusted with the responsibility of issuing a Code of Practice for workplace surveillance under Clause 50, PDP Bill 2019.
</li><li>The Code of Practice for workplace surveillance issued by the Data Protection Authority should impose a prohibition on monitoring of any unionisation related activity and prescribe penalties for the same.
</li><li>Trade Union affiliation should be categorised as sensitive personal data under Clause 3(36), PDP Bill 2019.
</li></ol><h3>Read the public brief and engage with the JPC</h3>
<p>For more information, we encourge you to read our public brief on the impact of the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 on workplace surveillance. The brief highlights the impact of workplace surveillance on the fundamental right to unionise guaranteed by Article 19(1)(c) and the fundamental right to privacy guaranteed by Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. It further explains existing provisions relating to workplace surveillance under the Bill and discusses their pros and cons. Following from the earlier discussion, the brief finally recommends five changes to the Bill to ensure that the existing power imbalances between employers and employees are not exacerbated by pervasive workplace surveillance.

13551,"#StartFromScratch: Why is the data protection bill being criticized?",startfromscratch-why-is-the-data-protection-bill-being-criticized-1,,,admin,2021-04-08,,Yes,live,"IFF Policy Team","<h3>Tldr</h3>
<p>In this post, the third in our series on the Data Protection Bill, we explain the various issues with the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. There is, of course, a lot to write about, so think of this as a list of the key issues with the bill such as: the dilution of user’s rights, non-consensual processing of data, ambiguities in the definitions, the threat of large scale surveillance, a lack of independence of the Data Protection Authority, and the stifling of social media
</p>
<h3>What we’ve already learnt</h3>
<p><a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/startfromscratch-the-data-bill-series-part-1/"">Part 1</a> of our series dealt with the need for a data protection bill, and illustrated emerging threats that threaten our modern digital life. We also provided some historical context for the Bill, and gave some updates on what the future lies with respect to the report of the joint Parliamentary Committee on the Bill.
</p>
<p>Then came <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/startfromscratch-an-explainer-on-the-personal-data-protection-bill-2019/"">Part 2</a>, in which we dug into the nitty gritties and explained the various provisions of the Bill. We began with an explanation of all the definitions and jargon, and then showed how the Bill:
</p>
<ul><li>provides users with certain Rights;
</li><li>lads down a consent mechanism for the processing of personal data;
</li><li>imposes on obligations on data collectors and processors
</li><li>lays down transparency and accountability measures to be followed
</li><li>provides the government with certain exemptions
</li></ul><p>We also provided an update on the Bill: the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Personal Data Protection Bill will now be <a href=""http://loksabhaph.nic.in/Business/UserBulletin1.aspx"">releasing its report in the first week of the monsoon session</a>. As we said, this gives us time to ensure that we, the citizens of India, understand and analyse the Bill so that India can implement a robust data protection framework that protects the rights of users.
</p>
<p>In this post, we want to highlight the key issues with the Bill that we feel require the most scrutiny. Our analysis here draws heavily from our earlier work under the <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/blog"">SaveOurPrivacy</a> campaign, through which have been writing about privacy regulations vociferously over the last 2-3 years. However, while we do go into some detail in this post, our aim is to provide a sampler of issues for the reader to engage with. A more detailed and in-depth dive into these very concerns shall be forthcoming.
</p>
<h3>Dilution of user’s rights</h3>
<p>Whilst the Personal Data Protection Bill does grant individuals certain rights and protections, it also makes the exercise of these rights difficult. For example, data principals can withdraw their consent for the processing of personal data; however, it is not as easy to exercise this right as it sounds. The Bill states that if the withdrawal of consent is without any ‘valid reason’, the data subject will have to bear the legal consequences of such withdrawal. Here, the burden to prove that the reason for withdrawal was valid <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf"">is on the data principal</a>. This is against the principle of consent under the Bill which requires that consent should be as easy to give as it is easy to withdraw. Further, it is not clear what constitutes 'valid reason' and what the nature and extent of the legal consequences contemplated under the section are. The threat of legal consequences would deter the data subjects from exercising their right to withdraw consent to data processing, questioning the freeness of consent.
</p>
<p>The Bill creates a further impediment to the exercise of the rights of data principals by allowing data fiduciaries to charge a fee from the data principals for processing their requests. Such a provision does not take into account prevailing socio-economic conditions in India, and the fact that in India technology is used by the rich and the poor alike. Hence creating a fee requirement would create a gap in the exercise of the rights under the Bill, where certain rights under the <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf"">Bill would become the prerogative of the rich</a>.
</p>
<h3>Processing of data without consent</h3>
<p>Chapter III of the Bill provides for certain grounds for the processing of data without the consent of the data principals. While some of the non-consensual grounds for processing data seem to be standard clauses, there are certain provisions that raise concerns. One such provision is that personal data can be<a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf""> processed by the State without consent for delivering services or benefits</a> and for the issuance of any certification, license or permit to the data principal. This is very broad and it needs to be balanced by giving some limited rights to the data principals.
</p>
<p>The most worrisome clause under the non-consensual grounds for processing data is the exemption given to<a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/blog/workplace-surveillance-your-employer-could-be-watching-you""> employers</a>. Employers can process the data of employees without their consent for the recruitment or termination of employees, for delivering services to employees, for verifying the attendance of employees, or for the assessment of the performance of the employees. These purposes are very broad and do not respect the privacy of the employees. The blanket exemption given to the employers from the consent requirement would allow them to engage in various monitoring activities under the guise of assessment of the performance of the employees. Indeed, such practices are already taking place: for instance, the PSU Broadcasts Engineering Consultants India Limited (BECIL) had put out a tender last year <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/legal-notice-to-becil-for-its-tender-to-procure-employee-tracking-smartwatches-and-a-mass-surveillance-system/"">to procure employee tracking smartwatches</a>.
</p>
<h3>Reasonable purposes</h3>
<p>The<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/essential-features-of-a-rights-respecting-data-protection-law/""> reasonable purposes</a> clause is another exemption that allows data fiduciaries to process data without the consent of the principals. The Bill also enumerates some grounds which count as reasonable purposes. One such ground is the processing of publicly available personal data. This exemption is untenable as it undermines the fact that informational privacy does not make a distinction of publicly available personal data. This is a very dangerous exemption as it allows both the State and private actors to process publicly available data of individuals for various purposes such as discriminating against individuals based on their political and religious views, political advertisements, profiling, etc.
</p>
<h3>Social media intermediaries</h3>
<p>The <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/essential-features-of-a-rights-respecting-data-protection-law/"">voluntary verification</a> of users of social media intermediaries raises concerns of violation of privacy and profiling of users. The Bill classifies certain significant data fiduciaries as social media intermediaries and requires them to provide mechanisms to enable its users to voluntarily verify their accounts. Such verified users are given visible marks of verification. User verification and visible marks impede online anonymity, which is an important feature of the internet. Anonymity is very important in online space as it creates a safe space for the users to express their views without any fear. And it goes without saying that an attack on anonymity is an attack on privacy. Moreover, it is not proven that anonymity fuels fake news, hate speech and the online abuse on social media.
</p>
<p>Another danger inherent in the voluntary verification of users is that the social media entities get <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/here-comes-the-bill-all-dressed-in-nil/"">access to official identifiers</a> of the individuals such as ID card, Aadhar etc. Identification documents are sensitive personal data and hence the sharing of these documents requires utmost caution and care. These measures give social media entities easy access to sensitive data which can be used for creating user profiles and engage in more advanced targeting.
</p>
<h3>Surveillance</h3>
<p>The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 gives the government unabated access to personal data without <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/watch-the-watchmen-series-part-5-the-personal-data-protection-bill-2019/"">adequate checks and balances against surveillance</a>. The various provisions under the Bill are in fact enablers of State surveillance. The exemptions granted to the State under the Bill empower the Central government to exempt ‘any agency’ of the government from the provisions of the Bill, and to prescribe the procedure, safeguards and oversight mechanism to be followed by such agencies. This is quite alarming as it enables the intelligence and law enforcement agencies to process the data of the individuals without being subject to the provisions of the Bill and engage in mass surveillance. With the government having the powers to lay down the boundaries within which the surveillance has to take place the Bill makes the government the arbiter of its own actions. The broad exemptions granted to the State can render the rights and protections granted to individuals under the data protection Bill meaningless.
</p>
<h3>Independence of Data Protection Authority</h3>
<p>An <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/essential-features-of-a-rights-respecting-data-protection-law/"">independent Data Protection Authority</a> (DPA) is one of the core principles of data protection laws. The DPA has a significant role in determining the rights of the individuals under the Bill and hence, for the effective protection of the rights of individuals it is pertinent that the DPA is an independent authority. However, the independence of the DPA has been called into question by the various sections under the Bill. Firstly, the Bill does not mandate the requirement of a judicial member in the composition of the DPA. This would lead to executive dominance of the DPA impairing the independence and accountability of the DPA. Secondly, the DPA is bound by the directions of the Central Government, which only adds to concerns about the DPA essentially becoming beholden to the Centre.
</p>
<h3>Government access to non-personal data</h3>
<p>The data protection Bill is a special legislation dealing with the protection of personal data of natural persons and the application part of the Bill makes it clear that it does not apply to anonymised data under section 91 as an exception. Section 91 empowers the Central Government to <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/essential-features-of-a-rights-respecting-data-protection-law/"">access non-personal personal data</a> with any data fiduciary or data processors for framing policies for the digital economy. This section seems to be a misfit in the Bill as the objectives behind the section are not in consonance with the objectives sought to be achieved by a personal data protection regime. Moreover, the extant literature doubts the existence of anonymised personal data as anonymisation can be reversed. We have voiced similar concerns about the draft framework for the governance of non-personal data, which is <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/unconstitutional-draft-report-on-non-personal-data-ignores-concerns-about-privacy-and-data-monopolies/"">thoroughly unconstitutional and ignores concerns about privacy and data monopolies</a>.

13552,"Privacy Policies of Telecom Service Providers - Or Why You Shouldn't Just Click Accept",privacy-policies-of-telecom-service-providers-or-why-you-shouldnt-just-click-accept,,,admin,2020-12-18,,Yes,live,"IFF Policy Team","<h2>Tl;dr</h2>
<p>We analysed the privacy of policies of the four large telecom service providers - Jio, Vi, Airtel, and BSNL - to check not only whether they were <em>Puttaswamy-</em>compliant, but also whether their policies would need updating in the face of the impending Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. We found certain issues in these policies, on the basis of which we have sent letters detailing our comments to these telecom service providers.
</p>
<h2>Why study privacy policies?</h2>
<p>On October 8th, 2020, Airtel updated its privacy policy. The updated policy stated that categories of information that Airtel would collect would include ""political opinions, religious beliefs and sexual orientation"". A week later, <a href=""https://scroll.in/latest/976249/airtel-updates-privacy-policy-denies-collecting-data-on-sexual-orientation-political-beliefs"">reports emerged</a> about the policy, with many users calling out the telecom service provider (TSP) on it's policy for violating the privacy of users.
</p>
<p>While Airtel has subsequently amended its privacy policy, the incident brought to light the need to ensure that TSPs, who both generate and process large amounts of data on a daily basis, have robust privacy policies that does protects the digital rights of users and complies with legal and legislative frameworks for data security. Additionally, given that The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 was introduced in Parliament last year, we thought it might make sense to analyse these policies from the angle of the Bill as well. In our analysis, we tried to focus not just on issues related to privacy and digital security but also organisational practices. For this, we used the framework provided by the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, and then compared the four TSPs on how they fared with regards to metrics such as the existence of consent sharing mechanisms and data transparency.
</p>
<h2>Airtel</h2>
<img src=""https://internetfreedom.in/content/images/2020/12/2.png"" class=""kg-image"" style=""width:480px;"" alt=""2.png"" /><p>Airtel may have updated its privacy policy, but significant issues still remain. For example, Airtel predicates the provision of services on the consent of the user to process data, explicitly stating that Airtel may discontinue services in which consent is not provided or is provided but then later taken back. Now, the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (PDPB) itself unequivocally states that “the provision of any goods or services or the quality thereof, or the performance of any contract, or the enjoyment of any legal right or claim, shall not be made conditional on the consent to the processing of any personal data not necessary for that purpose”. Thus, if the PDPB were to be passed, such a privacy policy would be violative of the Act.
</p>
<p>The PDPB also mandates certain additional safeguards for the processing of sensitive personal data, which are missing in the policy. Additionally, the policy states that Airtel may still have lawful grounds to process personal data once a user’s contract with Airtel has been terminated, even though the PDPB preserves the right to erasure. Data retention timelines and data anonymisation standards are missing from the policy as well.
</p>
<p>Airtel, like many other TSPs, requires us to send the famous 'DND' SMS to stop receiving product or service-related information. However, Airtel has not clarified whether sending the requisite SMS shall simply stop the delivery of service information or acutally stop the processing of the relevant data as well. Additionally, the policy does not state whether consent shall be explicitly taken before sharing information with authorised third parties. Lastly, the policy may imply that security practices and prcedures taken by third parties may potentially be lower than the standards and procedures that Airtel would employ itself.
</p>
<h2>Jio</h2>
<img src=""https://internetfreedom.in/content/images/2020/12/3.png"" class=""kg-image"" style=""width:480px;"" alt=""3.png"" /><p>As might be expected, Jio's privacy policy also has multiple issues. The policy notes that Reliance Jio, “may not be able to process your request of correction, updation or deletion, in case... it is extremely difficult to implement”. The PDPB explicitly acknowledges the right to forgotten, and so it may not allow exemptions due to ‘technical difficulties’. The privacy policy also states that “withdrawal of consent may lead to cancellation of your registration with us or your access to our services”. Additionally, even though the Consumer Acquisition Form states that certain fields are optional, the policy does not make it clear whether a refusal or withdrawal of consent of optional fields would also result in the termination of services. Once again, the need for a new consent sharing paradigm for TSPs is demonstrated.
</p>
<p>Jio's privacy policy does not specify the standards of data anonymisation or data retention timelines. It also, again, seems to imply that it may hold its authorised third party partners to lower standards than itself. Furthermore, the policy lists ‘hacking’ as a case in which Reliance Jio exempts itself from responsibility in case of a breach of security. Now, the DoT’s user license agreement<br />also specifies that “The LICENSEE shall be completely and totally responsible for<br />security of their networks.” Given that this is, in fact, a situation which is not<br />“outside [the] control” of Reliance Jio, it is regrettable that no additional security measures have been specified or planned to ensure that scenarios like the Big Basket data leak do not happen. Lastly, the ambiguity over whether the DND SMS stops the collection and sharing of data persists here as well.
</p>
<h2>Vi</h2>
<img src=""https://internetfreedom.in/content/images/2020/12/4.png"" class=""kg-image"" style=""width:480px;"" alt=""4.png"" /><p>The privacy policy of the newly established Vi too has certain issues. In the introduction, Vi seems to view the usage of services as equivalent to the provision of consent for the processing of data. However, clause 11(2) of the PDPB states certain principles that the provision of consent must fulfil, which may no be fulfilled by the policy as such consent may not be free or capable of being withdrawn. The policy also does not mention whether the withdrawal for processing certain data is viewed grounds for termination of services by Vi.
</p>
<p>In an Airtel-esque gaffe, Vi's privacy policy also seems to indicate that Vi may collect data about, “preferences for particular products, services or lifestyle activities”. This seems to be a textbook example of function creep, and the inclusion of such a clause is even more surprising given the recent furore faced by Airtel. The policy also states that one of the uses of personal data is “Inclusion in any telephone or similar directory or directory enquiry service provided or operated by us or by a third party”. If the collection of certain types of data is indeed mandatory for the use of services (as is implied, then this would then imply that inclusion in a directory follows the ‘opt-out’ model. An opt-out model has also been prescribed for the sharing of anonymised information with authorised third parties. Both of these would seem to contravene the directive laid down by the PDPB for the explicit provision of consent.
</p>
<p>In what seems to be running themes, data retention timelines and data anonymisation standards are once again both missing from the policy, while Vi too does not specify any consent sharing any mechanism for sharing data with authorised third parties. Yet again, ambiguity of the implications of the DND SMS remain. Vi's policy too seems to imply that it may allow the security standards of the third parties to be lax.
</p>
<h2>BSNL</h2>
<img src=""https://internetfreedom.in/content/images/2020/12/5.png"" class=""kg-image"" style=""width:480px;"" alt=""5.png"" /><p>BSNL's privacy policy is perhaps the most antiquated of the four, and thus is most in need of revision. A very basic error the privacy policy commits is that it fails to specify the types of data being collected. This would contravene clause 7(1) of the PDPB, which mandates providing information about the nature and categories of personal data to be collected to the data principal. Like the other TSP, BSNL fails to mention any consent sharing mechanisms for the processing of data, either with BSNL itself or with authorised third parties. Across various service providers, this is quite a large lacuna that must be addressed immediately.
</p>
<p>Chapter V of the PDPB lays down certain rights of the data principal, such as the<br />right to erasure, right to correction, and right to data portability. It is quite<br />egregious that the privacy policy fails to mention any of these, and is a situation that must resolved at the earliest. In line with what are probably 'industry standards', the privacy policy fails to mention either data anonymisation standards or data retention timelines. Unlike other TSPs, however, BSNL fails to mention even the basic security practices it is to follow itself.
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In a rapidly digitalised world, telecom service providers are a key nodal point for both the generating and processing of vast quantities of data. Additionally, most indians use the internet through mobile devices. Thus, it is extremely important to ensure that while using their services users do not find their digital rights and privacy compromised. However, as we have seen above, telecom service providers do not seem to provide safeguards in their privacy policies to secure the security and privacy of users. Such a situation is quite alarming, and illustrates not only the very pressing need for a data protection legislation (such as the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 or the <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DReq96e-FLsSoKUvK94_-VCtu2Y1PE97/view"">Personal Data and Information Privacy Code, 2019</a>) but also the necessity of strong regulation of TSPs with respect to data processing.

13553,"Data Empowerment is a result of Data Rights",data-empowerment-is-a-result-of-data-rights,,,admin,2020-09-30,,Yes,live,"IFF Policy Team","<h3>Tl;dr</h3>
<p>IFF has submitted its comments on draft Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA) Policy. In our comments, we highlighted four issues we felt the draft policy must address: firstly, that safeguards must be put in place to ensure that truly informed consent is taken; secondly, for sustainable innovation the policy must oriented the use of technologies towards the interests of citizens and move away from making financial sector models it's central framework; thirdly, that a firm and robust regulatory mechanism through a proposed Data Protection Authority for consent managers must be enforced; and lastly, that the role of civil society must be expanded from a watchdog to a important stakeholder with a seat on the table.
</p>
<h3>What is the DEPA?</h3>
<p>The aim of the proposed Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA) is to centre consent sharing mechanisms around the rights of users. It categorises individuals/organisations into four distinct types:
</p>
<ul><li><strong>Data Users:</strong> Bodies that look to process data to provide a serviceThese include fintech companies, credit providers, and banks.
</li><li><strong>Users: </strong>Individuals whose consent for processing data is being asked for.
</li><li><strong>Data Fiduciaries:</strong> Institutions that generate and control the data of users.
</li><li><strong>Consent Managers:</strong> Bodies that will mediate consent sharing between data users, users, and data fiduciaries.
</li></ul><p>The DEPA mechanism operates in the following way: a data user sends a request for processing the data of a user to a consent manager. The consent manager then asks the user for their consent. Should such consent be forthcoming, the consent manager then generates a consent artefact that contains details such as the precise type of data that will be processed, who is allowed to process it, and the reason for which the data is being processed. This consent artefact is then sent to the data fiduciary, who then, in a pipeline independent of the consent manager, sends the data to the data user.
</p>
<p>Such a model has already begun to be implemented in the financial sector. The RBI has announced a framework for Account Aggregators, who will be consent dashboards for the banking industry. A self regulatory organisation, Sahamati, has already been set up with the help of industry members.
</p>
<h3>What are the risks it poses?</h3>
<p>While such a framework that is primarily focussed on financial models of incentives and regulations may potentially help empower citizens, such hopes must be juxtaposed with the implementation challenges. Millions of Indian citizens possess low levels of education, with digital literacy a distant dream. In such a context, most users would be unable to truly freely choose whether to share their consent. Unaware of their rights as users and citizens, they may not be able to fully comprehend the implications of consenting to sharing their data, and thus risk a breach of privacy and security.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, progress on reducing the digital divide has been slow. The Centre’s own data says that as of 2020, “more than 15 crore rural households (94% of 16.85 crore households) did not have computers and a significant number of these households were likely to be digitally illiterate”. A 2018 report by the Digital Empowerment Foundation found that pan India digital literacy levels were no more than 10%. Existing schemes also suffer from focusing on knowledge about the use of computers, which fails to adequately address the problem as most indians access the internet through mobile devices.
</p>
<h3>A rights centric approach minimises risk, maximises data empowerment</h3>
<p>Our recommendations are clustered into 4 principle areas. We have cited several peer-reviewed studies and scholarly literature to buttress our claims and welcome further discussion on their merits on the <a href=""https://forum.internetfreedom.in/t/new-data-empowerment-policy-introduced-by-the-government-thoughts/1561"">Internet Freedom Forum</a>. 
</p>
<ul><li><strong>Consent in the context of citizen’s rights:</strong> The policy foregrounds the consent of the user as primary, which is commendable. It is also welcome that the policy envisions multiple pathways for consent manager business models. However, given the relations of dependency that would inevitably develop between consent managers and data users, as well as the mention of an opt-out model for consent in healthcare and banking, further safeguards need to be introduced to ensure the sanctity of informed consent. Additionally, while we recognise that the reversibility of the consent sharing mechanism may vary across sectors, as far as possible citizen’s right to revoke access must be upheld. Here we also strongly recommend against a default, ""opt-in"" of consent for which, an, ""opt-out"" may not provide for a meaningful safeguard.
</li><li><strong>Ensuring a citizen oriented policy:</strong> A strong data protection regime is an expression of commitment to the protection of the rights of citizens - it is not just a matter of a “prevention-of-harm perspective”. Thus, we must refashion our conception of innovation with human welfare and not just financial incentives. Going beyond viewing data as, ""oil"" or, a limited, property right, towards a richer conception of digital rights of citizens. For example, while acknowledging the need for increasing access to formal credit, we feel that an increased reliance on Fintech and microlending is not warranted, especially as they can end up having adverse social and economic consequences, and so an alternative usage of the data solicited has to be imagined.
</li><li><strong>Need for firm regulatory oversight: </strong>We understand that, given the nascent state of existing infrastructure, DEPA must be given room to grow and innovate. However, such growth must not come at the cost of the rights of citizens. A self-regulatory model may result in a situation where overriding the rights of citizens may be incentivised. Thus, a statutory government regulator such as the proposed Data Protection Authority must oversee compliance and set data standards, especially as the policy itself contemplates a large usage of DEPA in the financial sector where self-regulation has been proven to have deleterious effects. The nature of consent managerial organisations must also be clarified in greater details as to whether it is proposed they would on specific functions fall within the jurisdiction of data and financial regulators.
</li><li><strong>Role of civil society: </strong>It is welcomed that civil society is provided with a clear and substantive role in the proposed framework. However, its current role seems to be envisioned to be something along the lines of a <em>post facto</em> alarm bell to ensure the protection of digital rights. Firstly, while civil society must, of course, play a role in this, it is vital that the proposed Data Protection Authority steps in to definitively monitor such violations or at the least creates a body that would do so. Additionally, civil society organisations should be given a more direct consultative role in the creation of DEPA, as they may provide valuable inputs on the process.

13554,"Strengthening the Joint Parliamentary Committee process on the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019",strengthening-the-joint-parliamentary-committee-process-on-the-personal-data-protection-bill-2019-1,,,admin,2020-11-25,,Yes,live,"IFF Policy Team","<h3>Tl;dr</h3>
<p>The Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) for Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 is considering a revolutionary legislative proposal. To strengthen its process we have requested for two things. First, we have humbly requested the Joint Parliamentary Committee to work within its mandate and not be distracted by extraneous issues such as content takedowns of Kunal Kamra's tweets. Second, to provide a fuller perspective, we have asked the Joint Parliamentary Committee to consider more consultations with civil society who at present are only 10% of the total number of witnesses examined for depositions.
</p>
<h3>Mandate of the Joint Parliamentary Committee</h3>
<p>The Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) was constituted to examine The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (PDPB). According to <a href=""https://www.medianama.com/2020/11/223-jpc-twitter-kunal-kamra-tweets-sflc-in-letter/"">press reports</a>, the Committee recently questioned the social media platform Twitter over a recent tweet by comedian Kunal Kamra on which the Ld. the Attorney General of India has granted consent for initiation of contempt proceedings.
</p>
<p>Given the mandate and the volume of work to be considered by this Committee, such an action may fall beyond the ambit of the JPC. Further, the Standing Committee of Information Technology already exists and is more than capable of scrutinising such complex matters that involve issues of intermediary liability and content takedowns, it is better if such matter are left to the Standing Committee so that the JPC can fulfil the crucial task of providing a robust framework for the processing of data. This is a tremendous task and there are high public expectations that the JPC will act to safeguard user privacy through this path breaking legislation.
</p>
<p>Regardless, on the issue of takedowns, as at present there is an absence of a legal order requiring any such action as per the Shreya Singhal decision of the Supreme Court of India. We have witnessed such a situation Twitter itself before, as we noted in a joint letter endorsed by 243 lawyers when Twitter took down a tweet by Shri Prashant Bhushan (<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/joint-letter-to-twitter-about-removal-of-prashant-bhushan-tweets/"">link</a>).
</p>
<h3>Need for more diverse consultations</h3>
<p>The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 is an extremely important piece of legislation, and thus the holding of consultations with stakeholders is welcomed. However, as of 20th November 2020, of the 30 consultations held, 19 (63%) had been with industry bodies. Meanwhile, only 3 (10%) consultations have been held with a civil society organisation. Thus, we request the JPC that in the future it hold further consultations with academics, civil society, digital rights experts and organisations, and technologists.<br /></p>
<img src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/f5eY6rna5_0yy2-VxZxnkhILLhijtWigdMXwjvdm08s0PZ9nuB9_1Y99R8xkxKnnbm9aFT-V7zOWYx_0rXrMvEiv779C7e9UcfSfipmbaFVUtmjHLtQ4a-_UyPFDHsWgijpotPBl"" class=""kg-image"" style=""width:480px;"" alt=""f5eY6rna5_0yy2-VxZxnkhILLhijtWigdMXwjvdm08s0PZ9nuB9_1Y99R8xkxKnnbm9aFT-V7zOWYx_0rXrMvEiv779C7e9UcfSfipmbaFVUtmjHLtQ4a-_UyPFDHsWgijpotPBl"" /><p>Such groups can offer not only domain expertise but also a unique perspective on how best to regulate the processing of data beyond large technology companies or government departments. By helping the JPC understand how best to not only comprehensively protect the digital rights of the citizens but also ensure that social and economic justice are enshrined in our legislative framework, they can perform an important function and help build a more robust data protection law.
</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong></p>
<p>IFF has released its <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yBXSFO6759UTo-tBs1bRCb82azOAyCaX/view?usp=sharing"">Public Brief and Analysis on the Draft Data Protection Bill, 2021</a> in <a href=""https://saveourprivacy.in/blog/educate-and-advocate-for-better-privacy-protection-before-the-data-protection-jpc"">continuation</a> of our efforts to make available a public analysis that helps you discover the top issues and concerns with this legislative proposal. We hope this helps you form your own views and then voice them to help bring the power of civic participation to data protection!
</p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Let’s get some context</strong>
</p>
<p>I think by now we all have heard data classified as the “new oil” or “new fuel”. While the government has left no stone unturned in extracting the monetary value of data, a law that seeks to protect your data from exploitation has still not been enacted. After a (very) long journey, the Draft Data Protection Bill, 2021 (“DPB”, 2021) may be tabled in the Parliament in the Monsoon Session. Which means that this Bill might actually turn into an Act in the coming weeks (see <a href=""https://frontline.thehindu.com/the-nation/will-the-aadhaar-fiasco-pave-the-way-for-a-stronger-data-protection-bill/article65514263.ece?jr=on"">here</a>, <a href=""https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hope-to-get-parliament-nod-on-data-protection-bill-latest-by-monsoon-session-says-minister-ashwini-vaishnaw/article65090361.ece"">here</a>, and <a href=""https://inc42.com/buzz/government-to-get-parliamentary-nod-on-data-protection-bill-by-the-monsoon-session/"">here</a>). 
</p>
<p>Our feelings could not be more mixed about this incoming data law, as India desperately needs data protection legislation, especially considering the rush in which digital policies are being introduced (don’t ask us how many because we have lost count). But on the other hand, the DPB, 2021, which should empower the user with rights surrounding their own personal information, has failed to prioritise the user. It, instead, benefits the government and large corporations way more than it benefits users such as you and I.
</p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is this about?</strong>
</p>
<p>The point of the data bill is to empower you with rights relating to your own data. But in its current form, it provides large exemptions to government departments, prioritises the interests of big corporations, and does not adequately respect your fundamental right to privacy. This move, when taken with the lack of literacy around data protection in India, may be dangerous on an individual level - where your everyday privacy is threatened - and on a collective level, given how it makes allowances for mass surveillance.
</p>
<p>Maybe you are aware of the gravity of the situation. Maybe you are a “Data protection in India” newbie. Regardless of our awareness and understanding about this issue, the reality is that this incoming bill affects all of us, all our data and consequently, our fundamental right to privacy (see <a href=""https://youtu.be/Ykl8bcxFdxo"">here</a> for a fun explanation on the need for a data protection legislation)! We’ve been keeping a watchful eye on all things privacy in India for a while, and have been engaging deeply with the developments in the data protection framework in India.

<p>The industry, digital rights and civil society organisations, as well as experts have flagged several concerns over provisions in the DPB, 2021, which has been in the making for nearly five years. Inter alia, concerns around the DPB, 2021 include noticeable reduction in the autonomy of the Data Protection Authority, inclusion of non-personal data, supposedly voluntary self-verification of social media users, primacy to economic interest. We have thus summarised the top 10 issues and loopholes in the DPB, 2021.</p>
<p><img src=""https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Screenshot-2022-07-11-at-10.19.00-AM.png"" alt=""Screenshot-2022-07-11-at-10.19.00-AM.png#asset:13650"" /><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>We have also analysed how the proposed data protection regime has been deteriorating constantly at the expense of users’ rights, by comparing the DPB, 2021 with its predecessors, i.e., the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018 submitted by the Srikrishna Committee and the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 as introduced in the Parliament by MeitY. We have also compiled the dissent notes filed by 8 members of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (“JPC”) against the final recommendations submitted by the JPC.
</p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>It is not too late!</strong>
</p>
<p>Like we said before, the journey till this point has been long and full of roadblocks. But it is not too late to voice your concerns against the harmful provisions of the DPB, 2021. This time is crucial to raise awareness and put public pressure on our Members of Parliament so that they can enact a much better data protection legislation that will safeguard our digital rights and prioritise the interests of everyday citizens like you. We urge you to go through this and circulate it widely. We have made every effort to break down legal jargon and make it as simple and accessible as possible.</p>

<p>Today marks the five year anniversary of a momentous day in constitutional history, especially significant for the history of digital rights and freedom in India. On August 24, 2017, a landmark judgement by a nine judge bench of the Supreme Court in the <a href=""https://privacylibrary.ccgnlud.org/case/justice-ks-puttaswamy-ors-vs-union-of-india-ors"">Justice K.S. Puttaswamy. (Retd.) v. Union of India</a> recognised the right to privacy as a fundamental right under the Constitution of India. The declaration of privacy as a right and an integral part of the right to life and liberty was a watershed moment in the constitutional history of data protection. The historic judgement also has far reaching consequences for key areas such as mass and targetted surveillance, right to freely express one’s sexual preference, etc. The fundamental right to privacy was further cemented as the Supreme Court acknowledged its application across the golden triangle of the Indian Constitution, i.e., fundamental rights pertaining to equality and dignity (Article 14), speech and expression (Article 19), and, life and liberty (Article 21). </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3>Building on the landmark judgement in Courts of law</h3>
<p>Much has been written about the events leading up to the judgment in Puttaswamy, the arguments led by counsel who appeared before the Supreme Court, and the reasoning adopted by the 9-judges who delivered the verdict. To understand how the right to privacy has played out in the last half decade, it is important to understand some of the specific areas where the Right to Privacy has been specifically recognised to advance jurisprudence on certain issues, to grant protections to the public and to recognise the dignity of every Indian that must flow naturally from the preambulatory promise of the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>Puttaswamy famously formed the basis of the Supreme Court’s judgment <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/168671544/"">decriminalising same-sex relationships</a> in India, as well its judgment <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/42184625/"">decriminalising adultery</a>. The Allahabad HC was able to <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/158946068/"">uphold the right of choice in inter-religious marriages</a>. Several High Courts, including the <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/9058697/"">Uttarakhand HC</a>, the <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/55907061/"">Gujarat HC</a> and the <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/104109747/"">Chattisgarh HC</a> have relied on Puttaswamy to further reproductive rights of women. A division bench of the Delhi HC recently found itself split on the <a href=""https://www.livelaw.in/pdf_upload/ras11052022cw2842015190346-417219.pdf"">legality of marital rape</a>, where Justice Shakder relied on the Puttaswamy judgment to hold that marital rape is illegal. 
</p>
<p>Several High Courts, including the <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/46791034/"">Allahabad HC</a>, <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/94448930/"">Bombay HC</a>, <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/93651117/#:~:text=Mursaleen%20Mohammad%20vs%20Union%20Of%20India%20on%2019%20June%2C%202018&amp;text=on%2013.02.2012-,.,b)%20of%20the%20NDPS%20Act.&amp;text=The%20appellant%20retracted%20his%20statements,his%20detention%20at%20the%20airport."">the Calcutta HC</a>, <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/170404652/"">the Delhi HC</a> have relied on Puttaswamy to hold that various illegal means of investigation, search and seizure by law enforcement are illegal. However, limits to the application of Puttaswamy in criminal investigations have already begun to be placed. The Chief Justice of India wrote in a judgment <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/18061439/"">that</a> “the fundamental right to privacy cannot be construed as absolute and but must bow down to compelling public interest”, to allow the collection of the voice samples of the accused. The Himachal Pradesh HC relied on the above case to find that tests such as narco analysis and polygraph with the consent of the accused <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/124743678/"">would not violate</a> the right to privacy. 
</p>
<p>On digital rights, perhaps the most important development has been <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/82461587/"">Anuradha Bhasin</a>’s reliance on Puttaswamy to understand the proportionality analysis and hold that speech and trade through the medium of the internet are fundamental rights, and thereby any curtailment on such rights, must adhere to the principle of proportionality. Before the Anuradha Bhasin judgment, the Kerala HC had relied on Puttaswamy to say <a href=""https://indiankanoon.org/doc/188439981/"">that internet access would be covered by an individual’s right to privacy</a>. 
</p>
<p>While the right to privacy has already advanced Indian jurisprudence on sexual autonomy, criminal evidence and dignity among many other aspects, the informational and data privacy of Indians remains under threat. Beyond holding facets of the access to internet as a fundamental right, Courts have not decided several issues of digital privacy pending before them. 
</p>
<p>Over a year has passed since the Pegasus revelations, but the victims are <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/supreme-court-directs-committee-to-expedite-investigation-on-pegasus/"">nowhere near a resolution</a> of such an insidious invasion of their privacy. Conflicting decisions on the contours of the right to be forgotten have been pronounced by different High Courts. High Court petitions challenging the IT Rules, 2021, which intend to destroy encryption by mandating traceability of messages back to the original sender, <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/supreme-court-stays-proceedings-before-high-courts-challenging-it-rules-2021-interim-orders-to-continue/"">have been stayed</a> by an order of the Supreme Court, but no next date of hearing in the Supreme Court has been fixed as on date of writing this. Challenges to WhatsApp’s Privacy Policy have been forgotten. The Ministry of Home Affairs <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/delhi-hc-directs-mha-to-clarify-its-position-on-maintenance-of-e-surveillance-data/"">continues to block any attempt</a> at finding transparency regarding the aggregate number of surveillance orders it issues.
</p>
<p>The past five years have been busy. The next five may be busier still. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3>Privacy policy paralysis </h3>
<p>We have tracked developments on this front rather closely (and optimistically) as we continuously strive to ensure that the Government upholds this fundamental right for all citizens of India. Our fight for privacy and India’s journey to build a comprehensive privacy law began in 2017 when the Supreme Court directed the Government to bring out a robust data protection regime. We engaged with the three key versions of a data protection bill, i.e., the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018, the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (“PDPB, 2019”) and the Data Protection Bill, 2021 (“DPB, 2021”) through submissions to public consultations, filing RTI applications requesting transparency and proactive disclosure, sending representations to various Government ministries and departments advocating for privacy. 
</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the DPB, 2021 was imperfect (read our public brief on DPB, 2021 <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/a-public-brief-on-the-data-protection-bill-2021/"">here</a>). While it should have ideally empowered the user with rights surrounding their own personal information, it failed to prioritise the user. It instead provided large exemptions to Government departments, prioritised the interests of big corporations, and did not adequately respect our fundamental right to privacy. Despite these drawbacks, a bill in the making gave us hope that we were closer to a law with scope for significant improvement through judicial interventions and legislative procedures such as amendments. However, on August 03, 2022, the Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Shri Ashwini Vaishnaw withdrew the draft Data Protection Bill, 2021 in the <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pHWJ71FvI9u_Vp3xBuObo8QRTT7D-bvc/view?usp=sharing"">Lok Sabha</a>. The stated reason for the withdrawal was to accommodate the several changes suggested by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the PDPB, 2019 and to make way for a ‘comprehensive legal framework’ that can address the rapidly evolving technology landscape in India.
</p>
<p>We are very disappointed with the decision to withdraw a Bill that has been in the making for over 4 years, subject to long consultations and review processes (read our statement on the withdrawal <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/here-lies-the-data-protection-bill-2021/"">here</a>). The impact this delay has on the users is that as of today there exists limited remedy for Indians in case of any violation of their digital rights. Moving forward, we hope that the feedback and input provided by technical experts, civil society and digital rights organisations as well as several Members of Parliament in the form of dissent notes filed by them, be considered and taken into account while forming the new comprehensive legal framework. 
</p>
<p>In the existing legal vacuum on data protection, the country has witnessed the following incidents that have seriously undermined every citizen’s constitutional right to privacy:
</p>
<ul><li>Illegal surveillance through the use of <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/iffs-statement-on-hacking-revelations-made-by-the-pegasus-project/"">Pegasus spyware</a> against opposition leaders, journalists, the legal community, businessmen, Government officials, scientists, rights activists, and others. 
</li><li>The use of <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/delhi-polices-frt-use-is-80-accurate-and-100-scary/"">facial recognition technologies</a> by the Delhi police to investigate the North East Delhi riots, the Kisan Rally (Lal Qila Riots), and the Jahangirpuri Riots cases. This is especially concerning following the Delhi Police’s <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EeF-d5Z1pZVp6SZ5S-53iPZKNqen60Zj/view?usp=sharing"">revelation</a> that it treats all results above 80% similarity as positive results.
</li><li>Wide and disproportionate data collection as well as retention of biological and personal data under the <a href=""https://www.project39a.com/identification-bill"">Criminal Procedure Identification Act, 2022</a>. 
</li><li>Increased digitisation of valuable personal data by the Government through various digital ecosystems (such as <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/the-national-digital-education-architecture-an-explainer-2/"">National Digital Education Architecture</a>, <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/read-our-submission-on-the-unified-health-interface-consultation-paper/"">Unified Health Interface</a>, <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/explainer-account-aggregator-framework-saveourprivacy/"">Account Aggregator framework</a> and <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/tag/agristack/"">Agristack</a>), <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/a-flawed-idea-of-indea/"">frameworks</a>, and <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/the-government-wants-to-sell-your-data/"">policies</a>, in the absence of adequate safeguards against misuse of personal and sensitive data.
</li><li>The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) issued fresh <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/cert-in-guidelines-on-cybersecurity-an-explainer/"">directions</a>, ostensibly to strengthen the cybersecurity posture of the country, that raise concerns around state sponsored surveillance and data retention beyond need or purpose. 
</li><li>A blatant violation of the data security and privacy rights of almost 100 Muslim women due to the infamous “<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/iff-writes-to-the-standing-committee-bulli-bai-and-sulli-deals/"">Bulli Bai</a>” and “<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/iff-writes-to-the-standing-committee-bulli-bai-and-sulli-deals/"">Sulli Deals</a>” incidents, a fake online auction which severely impacted their constitutional right to life and free speech by displaying sensitive information without consent. 
</li><li>Government’s <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/104V9yn1ygjHjIdK92ZWz7P-oNvbjSrzY/view"">attempt</a> to collect and compile both demographic as well as biometric data of residents and link it with several databases, including the <a href=""https://forum.internetfreedom.in/t/link-your-aadhaar-with-your-voter-id-or-face-deletion-booth-level-officer-to-an-iff-staffer/3120?u=tejasi_panjiar"">electoral roll</a>. Such a step not only <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/aadhaar-undermines-informational-privacy-and-data-protection/"">undermines informational privacy</a> but also enables mass surveillance that breaks data silos and increases the profiling of individuals. 
</li><li>Monetisation and sale of our data, accessible to the Government as well as third parties, through the <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/we-have-written-to-government-asking-them-to-stop-risks-of-misuse-of-government-datasets/"">Vahan database</a> under the Ministry of Road Transport and Highway Bulk Data Sharing Policy. Given the high intensity of data collection, storage and processing envisioned by the Government, risks of data misuse and monetisation, 360 degree profiling and surveillance is high in the absence of a law to determine the regulatory landscape of protection of personal and non-personal data.
</li><li>Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the government’s inclination towards <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/joint-statement-ensure-equitable-access-to-covid-vaccines/"">online self-registration for vaccination without a walk-in facility</a> arose fears of further entrenching inequities in access to the vaccine. On an even more concerning note, several states and hospitals across the country made Aadhaar mandatory for accessing diagnostics, medicines, oxygen supplies, and even the vaccine. <a href=""https://theprint.in/health/modi-govt-now-plans-a-touchless-vaccination-process-with-aadhaar-based-facial-recognition/634719/"">News</a> about the Government deploying facial recognition facilities at vaccination centres for the purposes of authentication also saw strong opposition from the civil society. 
</li><li>India became a signatory to the “<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/statement-on-meas-rti-response-on-international-statement-on-e2e-encryption/"">International statement: End-to-end encryption and public safety</a>” which calls on technology companies to weaken end to end encrypted secure messaging by invoking concerns about public safety.
</li></ul><p>In several of these instances, the loss of privacy has led to the loss of dignity and liberty. One cannot lead a meaningful life in the absence of privacy. While we obtained the right to it 5 years ago, we are yet to truly interpret it and breathe life into it. </p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<h3>Privacy Supreme is here!!</h3>
<p>We will continue to engage and work with all institutions of governance, while constantly challenging and pushing them to ensure, protect and promote an individual's right to privacy. While we all wait for legislative measures to be introduced in Parliament to uphold the right to privacy decision of the Supreme Court of India, we encourage every reader and member of our wider community to celebrate today, reflect and share on what privacy means to them across social media. 
</p>
<p>Our celebration of the landmark right to privacy judgement, much like every year, is about to begin. This time around, we are bigger, larger and grander! This year, we have decided to bring <a href=""https://www.eventbrite.com/e/privacy-supreme-tickets-398773019837"">#PrivacySupreme 2022</a> to Bengaluru, which has always been an essential part of our community. We would be honoured to have you <a href=""https://www.eventbrite.com/e/privacy-supreme-tickets-398773019837"">join us for this year's event</a>, which will have two sessions:
</p>
<ul><li>A conversation between Aakar Patel and Usha Ramanathan on “Democratic rights and privacy in the pandemic years” which will be moderated by our Of-Counsel, Abhinav Sekhri.
</li><li>A panel discussion with Gaurav Godhwani (CivicDataLab), Kailash Nadh (Zerodha), Mahima Kaul (Bumble), and Uthara Ganesh (Snap Inc.) on “How can technology advance privacy?” which will be moderated by our Policy Director, Prateek Waghre.
</li></ul><p>The idea is to allow the IFF staff, members, donors, and wider community to meet, discuss ideas, and also have a little fun! In addition to the panels, we will have art installations related to our projects as well as by artists who have worked with us previously. After the event, we will also host a short mixer (with drinks &amp; snacks!) to allow all the participants and attendees to mingle.<br /></p>

<p>Today marks the 5-year anniversary of a momentous day in constitutional history, especially significant for the history of digital rights and freedom in India. On August 24, 2017, a landmark judgement by a nine judge bench of the Supreme Court in the <a href=""https://privacylibrary.ccgnlud.org/case/justice-ks-puttaswamy-ors-vs-union-of-india-ors"">Justice K.S.

A division bench of the Delhi HC recently found itself split on the <a href=""https://www.livelaw.in/pdf_upload/ras11052022cw2842015190346-417219.pdf"">legality of marital rape</a>, where Justice Shakder relied on the Puttaswamy judgment to hold that marital rape is illegal.

High Court petitions challenging the IT Rules, 2021, which intend to destroy encryption by mandating traceability of messages back to the original sender, <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/supreme-court-stays-proceedings-before-high-courts-challenging-it-rules-2021-interim-orders-to-continue/"">have been stayed</a> by an order of the Supreme Court, but no next date of hearing in the Supreme Court has been fixed as on date of writing this. Challenges to WhatsApp’s Privacy Policy have been forgotten. The Ministry of Home Affairs <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/delhi-hc-directs-mha-to-clarify-its-position-on-maintenance-of-e-surveillance-data/"">continues to block any attempt</a> at finding transparency regarding the aggregate number of surveillance orders it issues.
</p>
<p>The past five years have been busy. The next five may be busier still. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3>Privacy policy paralysis </h3>
<p>We have tracked developments on this front rather closely (and optimistically) as we continuously strive to ensure that the Government upholds this fundamental right for all citizens of India. Our fight for privacy and India’s journey to build a comprehensive privacy law began in 2017 when the Supreme Court directed the Government to bring out a robust data protection regime. We engaged with the three key versions of a data protection bill, i.e., the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018, the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (“PDPB, 2019”) and the Data Protection Bill, 2021 (“DPB, 2021”) through submissions to public consultations, filing RTI applications requesting transparency and proactive disclosure, sending representations to various Government ministries and departments advocating for privacy. 
</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the DPB, 2021 was imperfect (read our public brief on DPB, 2021 <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/a-public-brief-on-the-data-protection-bill-2021/"">here</a>). While it should have ideally empowered the user with rights surrounding their own personal information, it failed to prioritise the user. It instead provided large exemptions to Government departments, prioritised the interests of big corporations, and did not adequately respect our fundamental right to privacy. Despite these drawbacks, a bill in the making gave us hope that we were closer to a law with scope for significant improvement through judicial interventions and legislative procedures such as amendments. However, on August 03, 2022, the Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Shri Ashwini Vaishnaw withdrew the draft Data Protection Bill, 2021 in the <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pHWJ71FvI9u_Vp3xBuObo8QRTT7D-bvc/view?usp=sharing"">Lok Sabha</a>. The stated reason for the withdrawal was to accommodate the several changes suggested by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the PDPB, 2019 and to make way for a ‘comprehensive legal framework’ that can address the rapidly evolving technology landscape in India.
</p>
<p>We are very disappointed with the decision to withdraw a Bill that has been in the making for over 4 years, subject to long consultations and review processes (read our statement on the withdrawal <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/here-lies-the-data-protection-bill-2021/"">here</a>). The impact this delay has on the users is that as of today there exists limited remedy for Indians in case of any violation of their digital rights. Moving forward, we hope that the feedback and input provided by technical experts, civil society and digital rights organisations as well as several Members of Parliament in the form of dissent notes filed by them, be considered and taken into account while forming the new comprehensive legal framework. 
</p>
<p>In the existing legal vacuum on data protection, the country has witnessed the following incidents that have seriously undermined every citizen’s constitutional right to privacy:
</p>
<ul><li>Illegal surveillance through the use of <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/iffs-statement-on-hacking-revelations-made-by-the-pegasus-project/"">Pegasus spyware</a> against opposition leaders, journalists, the legal community, businessmen, Government officials, scientists, rights activists, and others. 
</li><li>The use of <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/delhi-polices-frt-use-is-80-accurate-and-100-scary/"">facial recognition technologies</a> by the Delhi police to investigate the North East Delhi riots, the Kisan Rally (Lal Qila Riots), and the Jahangirpuri Riots cases. This is especially concerning following the Delhi Police’s <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EeF-d5Z1pZVp6SZ5S-53iPZKNqen60Zj/view?usp=sharing"">revelation</a> that it treats all results above 80% similarity as positive results.
</li><li>Wide and disproportionate data collection as well as retention of biological and personal data under the <a href=""https://www.project39a.com/identification-bill"">Criminal Procedure Identification Act, 2022</a>. 
</li><li>Increased digitisation of valuable personal data by the Government through various digital ecosystems (such as <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/the-national-digital-education-architecture-an-explainer-2/"">National Digital Education Architecture</a>, <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/read-our-submission-on-the-unified-health-interface-consultation-paper/"">Unified Health Interface</a>, <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/explainer-account-aggregator-framework-saveourprivacy/"">Account Aggregator framework</a> and <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/tag/agristack/"">Agristack</a>), <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/a-flawed-idea-of-indea/"">frameworks</a>, and <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/the-government-wants-to-sell-your-data/"">policies</a>, in the absence of adequate safeguards against misuse of personal and sensitive data.
</li><li>The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) issued fresh <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/cert-in-guidelines-on-cybersecurity-an-explainer/"">directions</a>, ostensibly to strengthen the cybersecurity posture of the country, that raise concerns around state sponsored surveillance and data retention beyond need or purpose. 
</li><li>A blatant violation of the data security and privacy rights of almost 100 Muslim women due to the infamous “<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/iff-writes-to-the-standing-committee-bulli-bai-and-sulli-deals/"">Bulli Bai</a>” and “<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/iff-writes-to-the-standing-committee-bulli-bai-and-sulli-deals/"">Sulli Deals</a>” incidents, a fake online auction which severely impacted their constitutional right to life and free speech by displaying sensitive information without consent. 
</li><li>Government’s <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/104V9yn1ygjHjIdK92ZWz7P-oNvbjSrzY/view"">attempt</a> to collect and compile both demographic as well as biometric data of residents and link it with several databases, including the <a href=""https://forum.internetfreedom.in/t/link-your-aadhaar-with-your-voter-id-or-face-deletion-booth-level-officer-to-an-iff-staffer/3120?u=tejasi_panjiar"">electoral roll</a>. Such a step not only <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/aadhaar-undermines-informational-privacy-and-data-protection/"">undermines informational privacy</a> but also enables mass surveillance that breaks data silos and increases the profiling of individuals. 
</li><li>Monetisation and sale of our data, accessible to the Government as well as third parties, through the <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/we-have-written-to-government-asking-them-to-stop-risks-of-misuse-of-government-datasets/"">Vahan database</a> under the Ministry of Road Transport and Highway Bulk Data Sharing Policy. Given the high intensity of data collection, storage and processing envisioned by the Government, risks of data misuse and monetisation, 360 degree profiling and surveillance is high in the absence of a law to determine the regulatory landscape of protection of personal and non-personal data.
</li><li>Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the government’s inclination towards <a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/joint-statement-ensure-equitable-access-to-covid-vaccines/"">online self-registration for vaccination without a walk-in facility</a> arose fears of further entrenching inequities in access to the vaccine. On an even more concerning note, several states and hospitals across the country made Aadhaar mandatory for accessing diagnostics, medicines, oxygen supplies, and even the vaccine. <a href=""https://theprint.in/health/modi-govt-now-plans-a-touchless-vaccination-process-with-aadhaar-based-facial-recognition/634719/"">News</a> about the Government deploying facial recognition facilities at vaccination centres for the purposes of authentication also saw strong opposition from the civil society. 
</li><li>India became a signatory to the “<a href=""https://internetfreedom.in/statement-on-meas-rti-response-on-international-statement-on-e2e-encryption/"">International statement: End-to-end encryption and public safety</a>” which calls on technology companies to weaken end to end encrypted secure messaging by invoking concerns about public safety.
</li></ul><p>In several of these instances, the loss of privacy has led to the loss of dignity and liberty. One cannot lead a meaningful life in the absence of privacy. While we obtained the right to it 5 years ago, we are yet to truly interpret it and breathe life into it. </p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<h3>Privacy Supreme is here!!</h3>
<p>We will continue to engage and work with all institutions of governance, while constantly challenging and pushing them to ensure, protect and promote an individual's right to privacy. While we all wait for legislative measures to be introduced in Parliament to uphold the right to privacy decision of the Supreme Court of India, we encourage every reader and member of our wider community to celebrate today, reflect and share on what privacy means to them across social media. 
</p>
<p>Our celebration of the landmark right to privacy judgement, much like every year, is about to begin. This time around, we are bigger, larger and grander! This year, we have decided to bring <a href=""https://www.eventbrite.com/e/privacy-supreme-tickets-398773019837"">#PrivacySupreme 2022</a> to Bengaluru, which has always been an essential part of our community. We would be honoured to have you <a href=""https://www.eventbrite.com/e/privacy-supreme-tickets-398773019837"">join us for this year's event</a>, which will have two sessions:
</p>
<ul><li>A conversation between Aakar Patel and Usha Ramanathan on “Democratic rights and privacy in the pandemic years” which will be moderated by our Of-Counsel, Abhinav Sekhri.
</li><li>A panel discussion with Gaurav Godhwani (CivicDataLab), Kailash Nadh (Zerodha), Mahima Kaul (Bumble), and Uthara Ganesh (Snap Inc.) on “How can technology advance privacy?” which will be moderated by our Policy Director, Prateek Waghre.
</li></ul><p>The idea is to allow the IFF staff, members, donors, and wider community to meet, discuss ideas, and also have a little fun! In addition to the panels, we will have art installations related to our projects as well as by artists who have worked with us previously. After the event, we will also host a short mixer (with drinks &amp; snacks!) to allow all the participants and attendees to mingle.<br /></p>
<p>When: Saturday, August 27, 2022 at 5 PM
</p>
<p>Where: <a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/ZAvaY3QsLWMSf49k8"">Bangalore International Centre, Bengaluru</a>
</p>
<p>We hope that you will join us in our celebration. Please RSVP through <a href=""https://www.eventbrite.com/e/privacy-supreme-tickets-398773019837"">this link</a> and we look forward to seeing you there!
